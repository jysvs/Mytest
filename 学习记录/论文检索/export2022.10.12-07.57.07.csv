The novelty of our approach is that the solder paste is heated up selectively by an Nd:YAG laser through the flexible substrate, which is in most cases polyimide (PI). The amount of transmitted laser energy can be controlled and concentrated so precisely to the metallic parts (pad and solder), that it enables the application of solder paste with higher melting point as the temperature tolerance of the flexible substrate, thus solder joints can be formed on polyethylene-terephtalate (PET) and polyethylene-naphtalate (PEN) substrates as well. The paper describes the transmission laser soldering process parameters used for PI, PET and PEN substrates and SnAgCu and SnBi solders. The metallographic analysis and the pull strength measurement results are also presented. Based on our experiments it can be stated that our laser soldered joints of rigid to flexible printed circuits show similar quality and reliability properties to the reflow soldered ones.","","978-1-4244-2813-7","10.1109/ESTC.2008.4684465","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4684465","","Soldering;Polyimides;Pump lasers;Flexible printed circuits;Integrated circuit interconnections;Positron emission tomography;Polymers;Connectors;Power lasers;Copper","bismuth alloys;copper alloys;interconnections;laser beam applications;melting point;polymers;printed circuits;silver alloys;soldering;tin alloys","rigid-flexible interconnection;laser soldering;polyimide;mass reflow soldering;surface mount components;rigid printed circuit board;Nd:YAG laser;transmitted laser energy;melting point;polyethylene-naphtalate substrate;polyethylene-terephtalate substrate;metallographic analysis;laser soldered joints;flexible printed circuits;SnAgCu;SnBi","","","1","13","","21 Nov 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The integration of optical and electronic devices to achieve lower costs and higher functionality is attractive for a wide variety of opto-electronic applications. The key to innovation at the design level for these circuits is the availability of highly skilled personnel able to take advantage of sophisticated computer aided design (CAD) platforms. These tools enable them to undertake quick iterations of the design and simulation loop. The creation of such tools will need two interrelated initiatives: 1) The development of novel simulation and modelling techniques that will enable a robust and efficient simulation capability. These capabilities will include distributed thermal effects; modeling of non-linear optical devices; and the development of robust models for simulating circuits containing resonant devices. 2) The simulation and analysis of general, large and complex mixed electro-optic circuits. An important part of the development of these tools is physically based, fast and flexible compact models for devices such as integrated lasers.

"Asynchronous design: an enabler for flexible microelectronics","N. Karaki","Seiko Epson Corporation, Japan","12th IEEE International Symposium on Asynchronous Circuits and Systems (ASYNC'06)","20 Mar 2006","2006","","","1 pp.","xiii","Summary form only given. Flexible microelectronics technology featuring low-temperature polysilicon (LTPS) TFT and surface free technology by laser annealing and ablation (SUFTLAR) is expected to become a platform for developing thin, flexible and low-cost display devices. LTPS TFTs are good for realizing large area displays and integrated circuits at lower cost. A drawback of LTPS TFTs, however, is that they have substantial deviations in characteristics, which are caused by deviations mainly in crystal grain size and thickness of silicon-oxide. Until now, these deviations were considered to be beyond the capability of synchronous circuit design, especially for large-scale circuits such as microprocessors driven by global clocking. Since asynchronous circuits are ""self-timed"", they absorb the deviations of device characteristics. Plus they run as faster as possible in event-driven fashion dissipating less power, and remain on standby for quick service. Even with the benefits of asynchronous circuits, it is considered difficult to proceed with circuit design using syntax-directed translation using VLSI programming languages such as CSP, Tangram and OCCAM, syntax of which is far from the standard HDL. The authors then decided to develop Verilog+ that comprises a subset of Verilog HDLR and minimal primitives used for describing the communications between processes.

Laser diode (LD), a core component in LPT system's transmitter, realizes power conversion from electricity to high-intensity laser beam. LD's performance significantly affects the efficiency of LPT transmitter. Different driving current patterns lead to different electro-optical conversion efficiency (EOCE). The paper presents a novel LD driving strategy for optimal EOCE under different working conditions. To precisely estimate EOCE of LD, a simplified LD equivalent circuit model with only five parameters is proposed, which can readily be adopted to characterize any commercial LD using curves given in their datasheets. Though simplified, the model can still depict the power-current-voltage (P-I-V) characteristics well, and its accuracy is shown to be as close as its traditional counterparts. Based on the model, the optimal driving current strategy for maximum EOCE is derived for all optical power output conditions. A four-phase interleaved Buck converter is constructed to verify the proposed driving strategy. As all experimental results indicate, the proposed method enjoys a fine performance in improving LD's EOCE.","2329-3748","978-1-7281-0395-2","10.1109/ECCE.2019.8912873","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8912873","optimal driving strategy;maximum electro-optical conversion efficiency;laser diode;laser power transmission","Integrated circuit modeling;Optical transmitters;Equivalent circuits;Data models;Diode lasers;Power generation;Power lasers","equivalent circuits;laser beams;semiconductor lasers","four-phase interleaved Buck converter;driving current patterns;LD driving strategy;optical power output conditions;maximum EOCE;optimal driving current strategy;power-current-voltage characteristics;simplified LD equivalent circuit model;optimal EOCE;LPT transmitter;high-intensity laser beam;power conversion;LPT system;orientation ability;energy density;laser power transmission system;laser diode;maximum electro-optical conversion efficiency","","","","9","","28 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

From the performance point of view the small distances between chips together with the short interconnection routes have of great importance in order to achieve faster operation. The application of polymeric materials for the insulating and protective layers of interconnect substrates is beneficial to the performance and to the cost of a circuit module as well. An advanced technology for the fabrication of very high density interconnects applies microvia flexible substrates. This technology has particular significance for the interposers of chip scale packages.

However, the electrochemical performance of LIG needs to be further improved. Here, a one-step method has reported for fabricating laser-induced nitrogen-doped graphene (LING) by using a laser direct writing technology. A three-dimensional (3D) structure of LING was obtained by engraving the surface of urea-containing polyimide (PI) film with a pulsed laser. Considering the synergistic effect of high concentration nitrogen doping and 3D porous structure, LING-based thin-film supercapacitor showed an ultra-high volumetric capacitance over 1260 mF/cm3, much higher than that of LIG, and no significant attenuation was observed after 100,000 cycles.

The technology allows multi-layer routing with up to three levels having line pitches of 30 μm and 35 μm vias in staggered configuration using the standard process by photo structuring of the polymer.

The described technology has the potential to streamline and simplify the production of complex user interfaces which typically require extensive mechanical design and many components. The employed technique allows for the production of complex 3D shapes without the need to modify existing circuit board manufacturing equipment or processes significantly. To achieve this the device is manufactured in a flat state, encapsulated in a thermoplastic polymer laminate and deformed afterwards. This allows the usage of standard electronic components in surface mount packages, which are assembled using lead-free high-temperature solder. The circuit is deformed using a high-volume cost-effective thermoforming approach, where the encapsulating polymer is heated above its glass transition temperature and forced against a mold where it is allowed to cool down again. To enable significant out-of-plane deformations stretchable meandering interconnects are used, which were traditionally developed for dynamically stretchable devices. Fabrication of the circuit starts using a standard flexible copper clad laminate which is processed using the default techniques, the resulting circuit is then attached to a carrier board coated with a reusable high-temperature pressure sensitive adhesive. The interconnect and circuit outline is then defined using laser routing or punching, cutting the flexible circuit without damaging the carrier. The residuals not part of the circuit are removed, in a process akin to protective film removal, and solder paste is stencil printed on the circuit. Afterwards components are placed using a pick-and-place machine and the boards are reflow soldered. After functional testing and repair (if necessary) the circuits are placed in a vacuum press with a thermoplastic laminate, consisting of a thermoplastic elastomer and a rigid thermoplastic sheet. During this lamination the components are protected by a highly conforming press pad. Because the adhesion between the elastomer and the circuit far exceeds that between the circuit and the carrier the circuit is released readily as the thermoplastic laminate is peeled away. The resulting laminate is built up further using thermoplastic films and sheets, and finally deformed using a vacuum forming machine. The resulting device, which is trimmed to remove the clamping edges, can then be mounted in the final assembly. The advantages of this approach are demonstrated using a series of test vehicles, demonstrating the integration of complex circuits, connectors, and power circuitry. Finally, a series of design considerations that became apparent after initial reliability testing are discussed, together with the resulting design rules.","2150-5942","978-1-5090-4769-7","10.1109/IMPACT.2016.7799996","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7799996","","Polymers;Laminates;Printed circuits;Integrated circuit interconnections;Laser beam cutting;Presses","copper;elastomers;encapsulation;glass transition;integrated circuit reliability;laminates;printed circuits;reflow soldering;solders;surface mount technology;thermoforming","one-time deformable thermoplastic devices;flexible circuit board technology;process flow;one-time deformable electronic devices;standard circuit board technology;complex user interfaces;complex 3D shapes;manufacturing equipment;manufacturing process;thermoplastic polymer laminate;surface mount packages;lead-free high-temperature solder;thermoforming approach;encapsulating polymer;glass transition temperature;out-of-plane deformations;stretchable meandering interconnects;standard flexible copper clad laminate;high-temperature pressure sensitive adhesive;interconnect outline;circuit outline;laser routing;laser punching;protective film removal;solder paste;stencil printed;pick-and-place machine;reflow soldering;elastomer;vacuum forming machine;complex circuits;complex connectors;power circuitry;reliability testing;Cu","","5","","6","","29 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The common thick-film methods used today to fabricate conductive trace patterns on flexible boards are ineffective for resolutions below 50 mum. Thin-film technologies can fabricate high resolution patterns; however, they are prohibitively expensive for the low-cost flexible electronics applications. A number of direct-write methods were developed to address the mesoscale (i.e., from 1 mum to 100 mum) range; however, these sequential material additive technologies are characterized with a low throughput and high production cost.This paper describes a modified mill and fill (M&F) interconnect technology, in which the surface of a flexible substrate is first treated, next trenches with the desired width, depth and configuration are formed and then filled with a conductive polymer thick film (PTF) to produce a high- resolution conductive trace pattern. In the final step, the PTF material in the trenches is cured. Reported are results from two series of experiments. In both the substrate was a 0.125- mm thick polyimide film that was chemically treated to modify its surface energy. In the first series of experiments, 100-mum wide and 35-mum deep trenches were micromachined using an excimer laser. The trenches were then filled with PTF material using a squeegee and cured. The M&F traces were subjected to cyclic thermal and bending mechanical stresses and compared to similar direct-write and screen-printed conductors. The conclusions were that the M&F conductors are characterized with better adhesion and higher reliability compared to the other methods. In another experiment, high- precision conductive traces with an excellent edge definition, linewidths of less than 20 mum and a distance between lines as low as 6 mum were fabricated. The minimum linewidth was only limited by the laser micromachining capabilities and the size of the metal particulates in the PTF. The overall conclusion is that M&F is an inexpensive and reliable high-throughput technology suitable for high-density interconnect applications on flexible printed circuit boards.","1947-1947","978-1-4244-4338-3","10.1109/FEDC.2009.5069277","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5069277","Interconnect technology;flexible electronics","Flexible electronics;Conducting materials;Production;Paper technology;Integrated circuit interconnections;Surface treatment;Substrates;Electronic components;Costs;Conductive films","flexible electronics;integrated circuit interconnections;micromachining;polymers;thin film circuits","flexible electronics;ultra-small form factor;thick-film methods;direct-write methods;sequential material additive technologies;modified mill interconnect technology;modified fill interconnect technology;conductive polymer thick film;conductive trace pattern;thick polyimide film;deep trenches micromachining;excimer laser;cyclic thermal stress;bending mechanical stress;flexible printed circuit boards","","3","","25","","5 Jun 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We are developing several roll-to roll technologies using MID (Molded Interconnect Device) and low cost standard PCB technology (Printed Circuit Board) to produce soft, stretchable, human-compatible packaging. All those technologies are based on a sacrificial layer on where meander shaped interconnections are patterned. Those stretchable interconnections are connecting together non-stretchable functional islands on where SMD components are soldered. All the system is then embedded in stretchable polymer matrix, silicone rubber or polyurethane. All these technologies are using standards methodologies for PCB productions (lamination, photolithography, copper etching, reflow oven lead free soldering). A fast prototyping technology has been developed to ease the development of stretchable electronic circuits. Less than 1 day is necessary from CAD design to finalization: Rigid or flexible standard components or electronic sub-systems are interconnected with YAG laser shaped meander interconnections and molded in silicone rubber afterwards. From any kind of flexible circuit, stretchable circuit can be produced using this methodology. The stretchable meander interconnection can be stretched more than 100% and can sustain at least 3000 cycles at 20% of deformation. This paper presents a general overview of stretchable electronic process, a detailed view of the fast prototyping technology using YAG laser cutting, and the demonstrators developed in the frame of the European project STELLA (Stretchable Electronic for large area) [7] and in the Belgian project SWEET (Stretchable and washable electronic in textile) [8] and BIOFLEX (Biocompatible stretchable electronic system) [9].","","978-1-4244-2813-7","10.1109/ESTC.2008.4684558","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4684558","","Prototypes;Integrated circuit interconnections;Textile technology;Electronic circuits;Rubber;Flexible printed circuits;Humans;Costs;Standards development;Printed circuits","CAD;electronics packaging;integrated circuit reliability;laser beam cutting;printed circuits;prototypes;rapid prototyping (industrial)","prototyping;electronic circuits;biocompatibility;molded interconnect device;printed circuit board;packaging;stretchable interconnections;PCB;lamination;photolithography;copper etching;reflow oven lead free soldering;CAD design;YAG laser shaping;YAG laser cutting;YAG","","14","7","10","","21 Nov 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since the AgNPs have a strong optical absorption at 405 nm, a UV laser (405 nm, 60 mW) is used to trigger AgNPs to convert light into heat due to photothermal effect of nanoparticles. After UV laser beam irradiating on the AgNPs thin film, the AgNPs aggregate into larger conducting grains and improve the adhesion between AgNPs and the polyimide substrate at the same time. Then the desired AgNPs conductive lines (line width: 10 μm, line space: 20 μm) are formed after washing the unirradiated AgNPs. Copper plating is also used to increase the electrical conductivity of the laser direct patterning of AgNPs conductive lines. In this method, the conductive line patterns can be made by a low power consumption process (<; 60 mW) and with high energy transformation efficiency due to photothermal effect of nanoparticles.","2150-5942","978-1-4244-9786-7","10.1109/IMPACT.2010.5699559","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5699559","","Nanoparticles;Films;Laser beams;Copper;Photothermal effects;Silver;Substrates","copper;electroplating;laser beam applications;laser beam effects;light absorption;nanoparticles;photothermal effects;silver","silver nanoparticles;fine line;space fabrication;flexible polyimide film;laser direct writing;photothermal effect;optical absorption;UV laser beam irradiation;thin film;polyimide substrate;copper plating;electrical conductivity;laser direct patterning;wavelength 405 nm;power 60 mW;Ag;Cu","","2","","8","","20 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The desired meander shape pattern of the conductor is structured using a nanosecond pulsed laser source operating at 351 nm wavelength by the precise patterning of a 1 μm-thick conductive film deposited on a plastic foil. The cutout is realized by following the outer meander shape path of the structure providing an ultra-flexible/stretchable interconnect line.

The interconnecting parts and the PCBs have to fulfill a very important task within an effective electronic system: they have to provide the right electrical resistivity, RF parameters, mechanical and thermal properties, etc., to match the inputs and outputs of the different parts of a system. Conventional circuit carriers use the printed circuit technology (i.e. copper metallization with subtractive patterning), which is limited in regards to minimum feature sizes and usable substrate materials. In contrary to this, thin film type substrates, due to the application of semiconductor-like manufacturing processes for the pattern generation, are able to provide features with much higher resolution and tighter tolerances, combined with a wide variety of substrate materials to pick from. This paper will highlight general aspects of the fabrication of thin film flexible circuits, realized using different substrate materials. Fundamental properties and results from reliability measurements will be presented and discussed, also in view of practical use in different applications.","","978-2-9527-4671-7","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6698608","Thin Film;Flexible Circuit;LCP;Polyimide;Multi-Layer Circuit","Metals;Polyimides;Substrates;Lasers;Drilling machines;Standards","electrical resistivity;flexible electronics;integrated circuit interconnections;thin film circuits","thin film flexible circuits;electronic circuits;interconnections;circuit carrier substrate;PCB;electrical resistivity;semiconductor-like manufacturing;pattern generation","","","1","3","","2 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is non-contact manufacturing, flexible and controllable. Because of these advantages laser drilled microvias are commonly used in the microelectronics industry. However possibilities of laser ablation can be exploited in several other fields as well. These are: window opening for TAB IC, bending windows, ditches for microfluidics. The aforementioned applications require large processed area, controlled ablation depth and wall angle. The production of the so called bending window is a unique application of laser material processing. Bending windows can be used in flexible circuits to define the exact position of deformation. It is done by reducing the thickness of the flexible substrate in a well defined, narrow line. The effect of the material removal on the mechanical properties, such as tensile strength, flexibility, durability was investigated. Based on our experiences a new ""multiple V"" shaped bending window was developed from which longer lifetime and better mechanical properties are expected.

Thus, processing of temperature sensitive and low-cost substrate materials for applications such as covering or trim parts is enabled. However, laser assisted generation of highly conductive printed structures is often accompanied by defects such as line deformations and requires a deeper understanding regarding the influence of the laser process on the production of defect-free circuits. This paper explores the benefits and limits of laser assisted sintering of printed electronics promising a fast and flexible production of complex conductive circuits on a small time scale in contrast to furnace sintering processes. For an evaluation of characteristic properties, four point measurements and adhesion tests are carried out on the conductive structures.

Usually, optical subassemblies through flexible printed circuit boards (PCBs) connect with the hard PCBs to compose as optical transceiver modules. Because of the impedance mismatch of connection between flexible PCB and hard PCB, the operation bandwidth of the module can be limited. In this paper, the design of connection between flexible PCB and hard PCB in optical subassembly modules will be investigated for increasing the operation speed of the module. First, the transmission bandwidth of flexible PCB is analyzed. High-frequency performances of three transmission line structures, micro-strip line, grounded coplanar waveguide, and top ground micro-strip line, are investigated in flexible PCB. High-frequency performances of flexible PCB with different bending types are also investigated. The flexible PCB has been verified to be suitable to use in 25 Gb/s applications. Next, the high-speed transmission performance is analyzed through the connection between flexible PCB and hard PCB, because the impedance mismatch usually occurs at the connection. The ground pads are added near the signal line of flexible PCB, and the ground pads are connected to the ground layer in PCB through ground vias. The anti-pad in hard PCB is added under the signal solder pad. The dip of S21 response can be eliminated by the optimized ground pad. The impedance mismatch can be reduced by the optimized anti-pad, the impedance increases from 40-Ω to 49-Ω at the connection between flexible PCB and hard PCB, and the transmission bandwidth can increase from 16.5 GHz to 23.5 GHz. TO-46 header is a common and low-cost packaging solution for DFB laser and photodiodes. The connection between flexible PCB and TO-46 header is also investigated. While the connection has a gap, the dip of frequency response will occur at lower frequency. While the connection is very close, the bandwidth can be larger than 25 GHz. The flexible PCB, hard PCB, and TO-46 header are combined together, and the 23 GHz transmission bandwidth can be obtained. The 25 Gb/s transmission eye diagram is also measured, and the eye height, rise time, fall time, and Q-factor are 268.14 mV, 13.78 ps, 13.56 ps, and 8.76, respectively.

These stress-strain educed micro-fractures in the metal line reduce the reliability of the electronic system. We fabricated a durable conductor, integrating CNTs into the conventional metallization process. It was found that the CNT-silver composite can be screen-printed on flexible substrates and the durability of the resulting conduction was enhanced. Compared to CNT-polymer-based materials, the CNT-silver composite exhibited higher conductivities of 104 S/cm. These results show that such an approach offers a promising of enhancing the reliability of flexible electronic systems by utilizing reinforced CNTs in the metallization process.","1558-9323","","10.1109/JDT.2008.2005647","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4957489","Circuit reliability;thin-film circuit interconnections","Carbon nanotubes;Conductors;Flexible electronics;Conducting materials;Metallization;Printing;Stress;Plastics;Composite materials;Conductivity","carbon nanotubes;circuit reliability;composite materials;flexible electronics;metallisation;nanotube devices;silver","carbon nanotube reinforced conductor;flexible electronics;supreme mechanical strength;screen printing technique;plastic substrates;stress-strain educed microfracture;electronic system reliability;metallization process;CNT silver composite","","7","1","9","IEEE","19 May 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Conventional manufacturing process for SAW devices uses photolithography and metal deposition, thus requires accessing cleanroom facilities. This study presents an efficient and versatile technique based on a flexible printed circuit board (FPCB) for developing SAW acoustofluidic devices. By mechanically clamping interdigital electrodes (IDEs) made on the FPCB onto a piezoelectric substrate, SAWs can be effectively generated with an additional matching network. The SAW amplitudes were measured by a laser vibrometer, which increases with the applied input voltage. The FPCB-SAW device has been applied to actuate 10-μm microspheres to form strong streaming vortices inside a droplet, and to drive a sessile droplet for transportation on the substrate surface. The use of the FPCB rather than a rigid printed circuit board (PCB) can help cut down on the overall footprint of the device and save space. The low requirement in assembling the FPCB-SAW device can facilitate versatile acoustofluidic applications by providing fast prototyping devices.","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2020.3039760","Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2020JQ-233); Fundamental Scientific Research of Central Universities(grant numbers:3102017OQD116); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Fellowship(grant numbers:EP/P002803/1,EP/P018998/1); Global Challenges Research Fund; Royal Society(grant numbers:IEC/NSFC/170142,IE161019); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9286861","Acoustofluidics;droplet;flexible printed circuit board (FPCB);interdigital electrode (IDE);surface acoustic wave (SAW)","Surface acoustic waves;Flexible electronics;Electrodes;Printed circuits;Surface acoustic wave devices","acoustic transducers;bioacoustics;bioMEMS;drops;electrodes;flexible electronics;lab-on-a-chip;microactuators;microchannel flow;microfabrication;microfluidics;photolithography;piezoelectric actuators;printed circuits;surface acoustic wave devices;surface acoustic waves;vibration measurement","efficient technique;versatile technique;flexible printed circuit board;SAW acoustofluidic devices;interdigital electrodes;SAW amplitudes;FPCB-SAW device;substrate surface;rigid printed circuit board;versatile acoustofluidic applications;fast prototyping devices;surface acoustic wave-based acoustofluidics;conventional manufacturing process;SAW devices;photolithography;metal deposition","","3","","28","IEEE","8 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Chip size/scale packages (CSPs) were designed to meet these demands without the drawbacks of direct chip attach (DCA). The techniques presented until now allow complete package testing, thereby solving the known good die issue and can easily cope with changing die size and I/O design. In future, the customer will expect to receive a tested package with standardized I/O layout. However, manufacturing costs are still too high. This paper presents an approach in which standard low cost materials are used, the number of process steps is reduced and new bumping and bonding technologies are used in order to lower overall system costs. The CSP described, the flexPAC, is based on interconnection of the bare IC to a single metal layer flexible interposer using the fiber push connection (FPC) principle. The solder for this assembly is applied to a wafer with electroless Ni metallization using a new low cost bumping approach: meniscus soldering. Mechanical stability is incorporated by using a low stress, low viscosity adhesive dispensed between chip and substrate prior to assembly. Finally, the CSP is bumped on the backside using a highly flexible high speed solder ball placement method. The package is fully surface mount compatible, allowing for a wide process window. One important issue is package reliability. The results of thermal cycling of the flexPAC, and repeated reflow and humidity tests are discussed here.","","0-7803-4157-0","10.1109/EPTC.1997.723882","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=723882","","Costs;Chip scale packaging;Testing;Manufacturing;Assembly;Wafer bonding;Flexible printed circuits;Metallization;Soldering;Stability","integrated circuit packaging;surface mount technology;mechanical stability;integrated circuit testing;laser materials processing;microassembling;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit metallisation;adhesion;viscosity;integrated circuit reliability;humidity;reflow soldering;thermal stresses","CSP;meniscus bumping;laser bonding;laser solder ball placement;die I/O counts;die size;device cost;packaging technology;chip scale packages;chip size packages;direct chip attach;package testing;known good die;I/O design;tested package;standardized I/O layout;manufacturing costs;standard low cost materials;process steps;bumping technology;bonding technology;flexPAC CSP;bare IC interconnection;single metal layer flexible interposer;fiber push connection;wafer electroless Ni metallization;mechanical stability;package reliability;flexible high speed solder ball;CSP bumping;low viscosity adhesive;low stress adhesive;surface mount compatible package;process window;thermal cycling;humidity tests;repeated reflow tests;Ni","","2","4","8","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Assembly consists of bonding, lamination, encapsulation, solder ball placement and singulation. The bonding technique uses IBB (inner bump bonding) technology. IBB is similar to ILB (inner lead bonding), using an ultrasonic thermocompression single point bonder for TAB. Instead of the TAB inner lead, inner bumps are bonded to an Al pad. The polyimide film is drilled on the Cu trace by laser ablation. The inner bumps are made of an electrodeposited Cu core and Au plating. Various factors affected the Al-Au intermetallic bond: (1) inner bump shape; (2) inner bump deformation; (3) polyimide base film thickness; and (4) the adhesive properties. The Au layer deformation ratio was one of the most important factors; in the three bonded parts, the Au layer, Cu core and Cu trace, Au layer deformation affected bonding quality most significantly. A lower Au layer deformation ratio resulted in poorer bonding. A low Cu core deformation ratio resulted in a high Au layer deformation ratio and gave a good intermetallic bond between the Au plated Cu bump and the Al pad. Flexible PC tape had a thermoplastic polyimide adhesive layer on the die side, and the bonding area was reinforced by the adhesive layer during the bonding operation. The adhesive properties were also found to affect the intermetallic bond. Lower adhesive strength caused damage to the Al pad or Si chip during bonding. Strong flexible PC tape-die surface adhesion resulted in highly reliable bonding.","","0-7803-5090-1","10.1109/IEMTIM.1998.704529","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=704529","","Bonding;Gold;Polyimides;Intermetallic;Resins;Lead;National electric code;Flexible printed circuits;Assembly;Lamination","chip scale packaging;integrated circuit interconnections;soldering;adhesives;integrated circuit bonding;tape automated bonding;encapsulation;laser beam machining;laser ablation;deformation;ball grid arrays;polymer films;integrated circuit metallisation;adhesion;laminates","inner bump bonding technology;CSP;D/sup 2/BGA;die dimension BGA;flexible printed circuit tape;NEC CSP;solder bumps;reinforcement resin;assembly process;bonding;lamination;encapsulation;solder ball placement;singulation;inner bump bonding;ultrasonic thermocompression single point bonder;TAB;Al bond pad;polyimide film drilling;Cu trace;laser ablation;electrodeposited Cu core;Au bump plating;Al-Au intermetallic bond;inner bump shape;inner bump deformation;polyimide base film thickness;adhesive properties;Au layer deformation ratio;Cu core;bonding quality;Cu core deformation ratio;intermetallic bond;Au plated Cu bump;Al pad;flexible PC tape;thermoplastic polyimide adhesive layer;bonding area reinforcement;adhesive layer;adhesive strength;Al pad damage;Si chip damage;flexible PC tape-die surface adhesion;reliable bonding;Al-Au-Cu;Cu;Si","","1","","5","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These trends have highlighted the need for advanced microfrabrication technologies, which allow the on-demand digital fabrication of interconnections and die-attach bumps on chip carriers and interposers with challenging topographies. Laser printing, based on the laser induced forward transfer (LIFT) technique, has addressed such micromanufacturing challenges over the past decade. Several previous demonstrations of highly resolved and conformal interconnections for the bonding and packaging of micro and opto-electronic components are summarized in this paper. Latest advances in the laser printing and laser sintering of highly viscous nanopastes for achieving planar or three-dimensional (3D) structures consisting of Ag paste are demonstrated. The latter is achieved by stacking of arrays or bumps in a digital manner. The reported results verify that LIFT offers control over both the lateral and vertical dimensions. This control can facilitate the soldering process of heterogeneous components, whose pads have significant height and pitch dissimilarities. The applicability of LIFT in the fields of packaging and assembly of flexible and heterogeneous integration schemes, is further validated.","1558-4542","","10.1109/JSTQE.2021.3084443","European Commission; national funds; Operational Program Competitiveness, Entrepreneurship and Innovation(grant numbers:T1EDK-00814); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9442922","Laser induced forward transfer;packaging;assembly;chip bonding;Ag paste;digital printing","Bonding;Integrated circuit interconnections;Substrates;Printing;Packaging;Three-dimensional displays;Ink","adhesion;fine-pitch technology;flexible electronics;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit packaging;integrated optoelectronics;laser sintering;microassembling;nanoparticles;reliability;silver;soldering","laser-induced forward transfer technique;microelectronics chip bonding;flexible form factors;die-attach materials;conformal strain;adhesion;reliability;advanced microfrabrication technologies;chip carriers;laser printing;micromanufacturing;conformal interconnections;opto-electronic components;laser sintering;ultrafine pitch components;viscous nanopastes;LIFT;electronics packaging;electronics assembly;on-demand digital fabrication;three-dimensional structures;soldering process;heterogeneous integration schemes;flexible integration schemes;Ag","","1","","96","IEEE","27 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the production of rigid flexible board, in order to form a good profile in transition zone, it is necessary to use non-flow PP. We need to cut off the corresponding PP in the soft area, which is called conform. In the stage of mass production, the operation mode of PP conform is punch, but in the sample stage, especially when customer need to repeat the production of sample, in order to save the cost of the mold, many companies will use UV laser machine to replace the mold. At present, the market has mature UV laser equipment, although UV laser is a “cold cutting”, there is still carbonization at the edge of the PP window, this paper aims the influence of carbonization of PP window on the CAF. Different types of PP and different laser equipment will lead to different degrees of carbonization. In this article, we mainly study the carbonization of nanosecond laser, picosecond laser and femtosecond laser in the cutting of different types of PP. The selected PP contains 1037 RC63, 1067 RC62 and 1078 RC68, and combined with the CAF test pattern, to explore the impact of carbonation on CAF.","2150-5942","978-1-6654-3191-0","10.1109/IMPACT53160.2021.9696560","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9696560","","Resistance;Punching;Production;Glass;Laser modes;Routing;Windows","consumer electronics;cutting;high-speed optical techniques;laser beam cutting;laser beam machining","carbonization;UV laser cutting;consumer electronic products;rigid flexible board;mobile phones;blue tooth headset;tablet PC;good profile;transition zone;nonflow PP;soft area;mass production;operation mode;sample stage;mold;UV laser machine;mature UV laser equipment;cold cutting;PP window;different laser equipment;nanosecond laser;picosecond laser;femtosecond laser;CAF test pattern","","","","5","IEEE","8 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The line allows the manufacturing of flexible HiCoFlex multilayers in the format of 24rdquo times 24rdquo. Thus larger sized panels and greater production capacity are now enabled. HiCoFlex is a technology for producing flexible multilayer circuits using the conventional thin film techniques. The multilayer is built-up on temporary rigid glass substrates by repetitive application of polyimide layers by a spin-on process and metal layers by a sputtering and if needed enforced by galvanic deposition. Via's to underneath conductor levels are opened by laser cutting. The steps (metal layer by sputtering - photolithographic and galvanic processes - polyimide layer by spin-on, drying and curing - via's opening) can be repeated several times, resulting in a multilayer structure. Assembling and bonding of the components and tests of the circuits are possible while the film is still sticking on the glass, avoiding handling problems of conventional flexprints. At the end the flex multilayer is released from the substrate making use of a special release layer. Applications of HiCoFlex multilayers are in the fields of high-density interconnect (HDI) technologies for sensors, industrial and medical micro systems. In addition, the unique combination of a flexible material with the electrical properties of a MCM-D offers new applications in the field of 3D-packaging. Application fields of such highly integrated modules are strongly growing areas like medical and health monitoring, both for implanted and non-implanted medical devices, sensors, portable and wearable electronic systems. In this paper the properties and features of these flex as well as some applications are discussed.","","978-1-4244-4722-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5272916","Multilayer flex;HiCoFlex;Thin Film;3D-package;Medical device","Nonhomogeneous media;Transistors;Sputtering;Production;Thin film circuits;Flexible printed circuits;Glass;Substrates;Polyimides;Galvanizing","electronics packaging;flexible electronics;photolithography;printed circuit manufacture;thin films","large panel highly flexible multilayer thin film boards;photolithographic process;galvanic process","","1","1","7","","29 Sep 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Compared with the conventional laser spot pointer, the laser pattern generated by this pointer is: 1) of higher capability to draw audience's attention; 2) more comfortable to eyes due to its no-glaring and uniform brightness with lower average laser power density within the time required for human's perception of an image; 3) able to highlight a row/column/area. The FRSS micromirror consists of a FPCB moving electrode sandwiched by a square and ring PCB electrodes. A silicon mirror plate is bonded on the moving electrode's top. The FRSS micromirror can accommodate the unflatness of polyimide supporting beams to significantly reduce the performance variation associated with the previously reported FPCB micromirror with 2-3 times higher torque.

Main advantage of this process is the high flexibility of laser processing three dimensional circuitries. Moreover, fine layout structures can be achieved by using a minimized laser spot. Therefore, the matrix polymer is filled with a special additive, enabling laser activation and sufficient metallization. To further improve the metallization quality and the coefficient of thermal expansion, high contents of inorganic fillers are added to the matrix polymer. However, this results in a low elongation at break, making the materials brittle. This is a major challenge especially for thin walls and films. In the present paper the potential for using films in combination with the LPKF-LDS process is considered for a use in flexible circuit carriers or for backmolding applications. Therefore, the content of talc in the polymer matrix is successively increased to determine the required minimum for appropriate metallization results. The compounds are extruded to films of different thicknesses. Using a Chill-Roll-Unit, one side of the films is smoothed. The films are structured, using different laser parameters and metallized, whereas these areas are investigated and evaluated using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Furthermore, the plating thickness is measured as well as the roughness of the untreated samples. The metal deposition of the films is also compared to injection molded samples, especially regarding the surface structure. It can be shown, that an increasing amount of talc improves the plating thickness in contrast to poor metal deposition adding only LDS additive. The different surface structures of the Chill-Roll- Side and untreated side show no significant influence on the plating results. The achieved plating thickness seems comparable to injection molded parts of the same material.","","978-1-5090-5428-2","10.1109/ICMID.2016.7738919","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7738919","Molded-Interconnect-Devices;Laser direct structuring;Films;Talc;Plating","Films;Metallization;Plating;Additives;Integrated circuit interconnections","brittleness;elongation;extrusion;flexible electronics;laser materials processing;metallisation;moulding;optical microscopy;polymer films;scanning electron microscopy;thermal expansion","polymer films;laser-structured circuit carriers;molded interconnect devices;MID;laser-direct-structuring technology;3D circuitries;minimized laser spot;matrix polymer;laser activation;metallization;thermal expansion;inorganic fillers;elongation at break;brittle materials;LPKF-LDS process;flexible circuit carriers;backmolding applications;talc content;extrusion;chill-roll-unit;light microscopy;scanning electron microscopy;plating thickness;metal deposition;injection molded parts","","","","15","","24 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Vias, in 125 μm thick PET, were laser cut (50, 100, 150, and 200 μm nominal diameter) then filled, and simultaneously connected to adjacent vias, by screen printing. To investigate the use of the printed via in a monolithic energy module, the vias were used for the fabrication of a flexible printed supercapacitor (aqueous electrolyte and carbon electrode). The results indicate that the lower viscosity silver ink (DuPont 5064H) does not fill the via as effectively as the higher viscosity ink (Asahi LS411AW), and only the sidewall of the vias are coated as the via size increases (≥ 150 μm diameter). Conversely, the Asahi silver paste fills the via more thoroughly and exhibited a 100 % yield (1010 vias; 100 μm nominal via diameter) with the 2-step direct screen-printing method. The bending test showed no signs of via specific breakdown after 30 000 cycles.

This tutorial reviews the important properties and performance characteristics of devices such as LEDs, photodiodes, transistor-based displays, and lasers. Organic semiconductor based photoconductors are extensively used in xerographic photoreceptors and constitute the first large market for organic semiconductors. Small molecule and conjugated polymer light-emitting diodes are on the verge of large-scale commercialization, with the first products having recently appeared. The past few years have seen impressive strides being made in improving the efficiency and stability of such devices. Luminous efficiencies >40 lumens/watt have been attained. High-efficiency blue, green, red, and white LEDs have been reported with both small-molecule based materials systems and conjugated polymers. Organic-based photodiodes and solar cells based on photo-induced charge transfer have also been the subject of research and internal quantum efficiencies of >50% have been reported. Flexible organic transistor circuits have been used as backplanes in novel paper-like electronic displays. Injection lasers, the holy grail of organic optoelectronics, have turned out to be difficult to realize until very recently. Absorption losses caused by injected carriers and low carrier mobilities are some of the problems, while the 4-level nature of organic semiconductors and high gain are some of the advantages.","","1-55752-706-7","10.1109/CLEO.2002.1034199","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1034199","","Light emitting diodes;Organic semiconductors;Photodiodes;Semiconductor lasers;Organic light emitting diodes;Flat panel displays;Photoconducting devices;Photoreceptors;Large-scale systems;Commercialization","organic light emitting diodes;organic semiconductors;photoconducting materials;optical polymers;conducting polymers;photodiodes;solar cells;semiconductor lasers;transistor circuits","organic optoelectronics;photodiodes;transistor-based displays;lasers;organic semiconductor based photoconductors;xerographic photoreceptors;conjugated polymer light-emitting diodes;small molecule light-emitting diodes;large-scale commercialization;efficiency;stability;luminous efficiencies;blue LED;green LED;red LED;white LED;solar cells;photo-induced charge transfer;internal quantum efficiencies;flexible organic transistor circuits;backplanes;paper-like electronic displays;injection lasers;absorption losses;injected carriers;low carrier mobilities;high gain","","","","","","15 Apr 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Flexible capacitors have the potential to replace conventional batteries as they can provide competitive energy storage while being much smaller in size and having greater lifetime than average lithium-ion batteries. The most used design for in-plane flexible micro-supercapacitors is the interdigitated design. However, from findings of various recent studies, it is believed that the capacitance of in-plane EDLC micro-supercapacitors can further be improved by changing electrode designs. Different fractal designs have shown great promise to enhance the electrochemical performance of in-plane micro-supercapacitors by maximizing the active surface area and minimizing the energy lost during ion-transport. In this work, we successfully fabricate graphene-based, laser-scribed flexible micro-supercapacitors and study the effects of change in geometry parameters on total capacitance. Four different geometries for electrode were designed i.e., (1) interdigitated design, (2) fractal F1 (Hilbert) design, (3) fractal F2 (Peano) design, and (4) fractal F3 (Moore) design, and were patterned onto the thin layer of graphene oxide using laser scribing technique. Detailed analysis was presented for the change in capacitance using cyclic voltammetry, galvanic charge-discharge, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and electrostatic simulation using COMSOL Multiphysics. It was found that fractal design micro-supercapacitors give better performance with higher capacitance and energy density values in comparison to conventional design interdigitated micro-supercapacitors. Among all, Fractal F3 design showed the highest capacitance and energy density value in comparison to other devices. It was found that there were two factors affecting the performance of devices, i.e., (1) a higher active surface area for fractal designs as compared to interdigitated designs with the same unit area, and (2) in addition to electric double layer capacitance, there was also electric field being generated on the edges of electrodes, defined as edging effect. Among both factors, the latter was the major enhancer of capacitance in the fractal design devices.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3128320","National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST) Internal Research Funding; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9615087","Fractal;electric double layer capacitor;flexible electronics;graphene;laser scribing;COMSOL multiphysics;micro-supercapacitor","Fractals;Supercapacitors;Electrodes;Graphene;Lasers;Capacitance;Performance evaluation","capacitance;electrochemical electrodes;electrochemical impedance spectroscopy;electrochemistry;electrodes;energy storage;graphene;lithium compounds;secondary cells;supercapacitors;voltammetry (chemical analysis)","laser scribed graphene-based flexible microsupercapacitors;flexible capacitors;competitive energy storage;average lithium-ion batteries;in-plane flexible microsupercapacitors;in-plane EDLC microsupercapacitors;electrode designs;different fractal designs;in-plane microsupercapacitors;laser-scribed flexible microsupercapacitors;laser scribing technique;fractal design microsupercapacitors;Fractal F3 design;energy density value;higher active surface area;electric double layer capacitance;fractal design devices","","","","60","CCBY","15 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recently it has been demonstrated that polyimide (commercially available as Kapton®) films carbonizes in a surprisingly effective and simple fashion by illumination of medium power (~100mW) ns to ms range laser pulses in air. The resulting carbon layers have been shown to be of a random network of 3D and 2D graphitic structures that bestow the final layer sufficient conductivity (1 to 10 Ω-cm) that can be used in practical applications, especially for sensor and electrochemical applications. However, being a relatively novel process, a detailed account of process optimization and reliability of the conducting structures have not been yet provided, which is provided in this work. Moreover, additional examples of materials responsive to laser scribing process and passive RC-based sensors are also introduced. 1n addition, we methodically explore typical process parameter space to decouple the complex interplay between laser speed, pulse width, line spacing and laser power for the laser scribe process as well as investigating the longevity and statistical nature of device performance. 1n particular, we pay attention to humidity conditions and indicate how some of potential weakness can be turned to strengths for sensor applications. Therefore, we report on the optimal processing conditions, reliability of passive device performance and chemical stability of laser scribed carbon electrodes which can be applied to practical sensor development.","","978-1-7281-1778-2","10.1109/IFETC46817.2019.9073707","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9073707","","","electrodes;flexible electronics;graphene;graphite;laser materials processing;passive networks;RC circuits;sensors","laser scribed carbon layers;high-conductivity flexible electronic material;ms range laser pulses;2D graphitic structures;electrochemical applications;conducting structures;laser scribing process;passive RC-based sensors;process parameter space;laser speed;line spacing;laser power;laser scribed carbon electrodes;low-cost preparation techniques;polyimide;graphene;C","","","","11","","23 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With this fully automatic system, the high speed solder ball bumper (SB/sup 2/), preformed solder balls are placed at pre-programmed bond positions and are reflowed by a laser pulse in a single step. The use of flux or second reflow is not necessary. The system design fits a broad range of applications. Due to the low heat input during solder deposition, and the fact that additional component heating is not required, this method is especially interesting for temperature sensitive devices. Besides bumping processes on single dice or at wafer level, solder balls for IC packages such as /spl mu/-BGAs, BGAs and chip size packages can be placed and reflowed. Other applications include solder deposition for PCBs and interconnection of 3D automotive sensor chip packages. With small modifications, the SB/sup 2/ can process solder balls with diameters from 100 /spl mu/m up to 1 mm. A singulation unit separates the balls from the bulk by means of a rotating cavity disk. Using a pneumatic pulse, the ball is transported from the cavity down to the capillary tip. The solder ball reflow is performed with a laser beam that passes through a glass fiber into the capillary directly above the placed ball. During laser pulsing, nitrogen prevents oxidation of the liquid solder. The SB/sup 2/ also provides great flexibility for microelectronic device repair. The system can be used to realise a repair station attached to the normal process flow. It allows a selective removal of defective solder bumps and renewed solder attach to the contact pads.","","0-7803-4520-7","10.1109/IEMTE.1998.723062","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=723062","","Wafer scale integration;Microelectronics;Integrated circuit packaging;Fiber lasers;Bonding;Pulsed laser deposition;Optical pulses;Heating;Temperature sensors;Automotive engineering","reflow soldering;printed circuit manufacture;integrated circuit interconnections;electric sensing devices;automotive electronics;flexible manufacturing systems;ball grid arrays;chip scale packaging;laser materials processing;maintenance engineering;assembling;micromechanical devices","SB/sup 2/ solder ball bumper;flexible manufacturing tool;3D sensor packages;3D microsystem packages;high speed solder deposition system;microelectronic devices;solder ball bumper;preformed solder ball placement;pre-programmed bond positions;laser pulse reflow;heat input;solder deposition;temperature sensitive devices;bumping processes;wafer level bumping;solder balls;IC packages;micro-BGAs;BGAs;chip size packages;PCBs;3D automotive sensor chip package interconnection;solder ball diameter;singulation unit;rotating cavity disk;pneumatic pulse ball transport;capillary tip;solder ball reflow;glass fiber;laser pulsing;nitrogen atmosphere;liquid solder oxidation prevention;microelectronic device repair;repair station;process flow;selective defective solder bump removal;renewed solder attach;contact pads;100 micron to 1 mm","","8","1","10","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The need for high-density interconnection to support 3-D integration has led to a growing demand for the development of fine-pitch and small vias on the interposer. Polyimide base films have been used extensively for flexible and high-density electronic interconnection applications because they offer good thermal and chemical stability with a lower dielectric constant. In this paper, the development of interconnect technology using an ultrathin flexible polyimide interposer (UFPI) for 2.5-D/3-D packaging applications is described in detail.

The requirement on the circuit density of substrate, especially, is intensive for chip scale packages (CSP) and system-in-package (SIP), where the chip size is reduced and its pin-count number is increased. Thus, the formation of small and dense via is becoming more and more important for increasing the circuit density of substrate. In this paper, ultra-fine blind via with solid Cu filled at an entry diameter of 20μm, over the current blind via size of 50-200μm by CO2 laser drilling, is demonstrated on polyimide based flexible substrate. Its advantages of the present innovation compared to the PTH in conventional substrate technology and micro-blind via structure in advanced high density interconnect (HDI) technology will be explored. In conclusions, the reliability of the ultra-fine blind vias has been assessed in 2-metal tape ball grid array (TBGA) and daisy chain modules at substrate level, subjected to JEDEC MST L3 at 260°C, Air to Air thermal cycle and thermal shock, T/H bias, pressure cooker test and low/high temperature storage tests, etc. In addition, the Cu fully filled ultra-fine blind via makes ""landless"" structure feasible on the substrate, further increasing the circuit density of substrate. In the end, the ultra-fine Cu filled blind via technology has introduced to the production in Compass for SIP, 2-metal layer chip-on-flex (COF) and multi-layer buildup flex, etc.","1089-8190","978-1-4244-0729-3","10.1109/IEMT.2006.4456425","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4456425","Blind via;High-density;flexible substrate;IC packaging","Integrated circuit interconnections;Electronics packaging;Chip scale packaging;Circuit testing;Solid lasers;Drilling;Polyimides;Technological innovation;Electric shock;Temperature","ball grid arrays;chip scale packaging;copper;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit testing;laser beam machining;substrates;system-in-package","high-density interconnect technology;polyimide-based flexible substrate;portable multifunctional compact electronic product;interconnection technology;electronic packaging;chip scale packages;system-in-package;pin-count number;ultra-fine blind via technology;CO2 laser drilling;2-metal tape ball grid array;daisy chain modules;thermal cycle test;thermal shock test;pressure cooker test;temperature storage tests;2-metal layer chip-on-flex;multilayer buildup flex;size 20 mum;size 50 mum to 200 mum;temperature 260 C;Cu","","1","","7","","25 Feb 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Several such applications can benefit from arrays with a small footprint and endoscopic form factor. However, critical challenges arise in making electrical connections to array elements in such spatial constraints. In this work, we describe a method to pattern a high-density flexible circuit cabling on a copper-on polyimide film, using laser ablation of a polymer resist and wet etching, and then demonstrate a connection to a micro-US array. We investigate laser ablation process parameters and evaluate the ability to consistently pattern continuous copper traces. A minimum 30- $\mu \text{m}$  pitch was achieved with 5- $\mu \text{m}$ -wide electrode lines, and continuity of a 5-m-long trace is demonstrated. A flexible circuit with 30-mm-long traces with 30- $\mu \text{m}$  line and 30- $\mu \text{m}$  space before fan-out was fabricated to connect in an interleaved manner to a 32-element array with 30- $\mu \text{m}$  element pitch. Metal deposition and laser ablation were used to connect and pattern the element electrodes to the copper traces of the flexible circuit. Electrical and acoustic measurements show good yield and consistent impedance across channels. Element pulse-echo tests demonstrated device functionality; the two-way pulse had 43-MHz center frequency and 40% fractional bandwidth (−6 dB). The proposed manufacturing methods facilitate the prototyping and fabrication of flexible endoscopic or small-footprint micro-US devices.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2022.3189338","Terry Fox Research Institute New Frontiers Program Project Grant in Porphysome Nanoparticle-Enabled Image Guided Cancer Interventions; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada through the Discovery(grant numbers:RGPIN-2017-06834); Ontario Graduate Scholarship; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9819946","Acoustic characterization;electrical characterization;electrode patterning;excimer laser;fine pitch;flexible circuit cabling;high-frequency ultrasound;high-density interconnect;laser lithography;laser machining;metal deposition;miniaturization;polyimide;transducer array","Resists;Laser ablation;Copper;Transducers;Substrates;Polyimides;Metals","","","Copper;Equipment Design;Polymers;Transducers;Ultrasonography","","","42","IEEE","7 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The next challenge for optical interconnects is to move to a serial data-rate of 25Gb/s or higher [1,2]. To achieve flexible interconnects on a bandwidth demand, a CDR is required to operate at multiple rates in a wide tuning range. A selectable multi-VCO structure is one method to overcome this issue. However, when multi-VCOs are allocated in each channel, the large size of VCOs makes it difficult to achieve a high-density optical link. In this paper, we presenta dual-loop hybrid CDR including a phase interpolator (PI) loop for phase tracking and a common VCO loop situated outside the channel areas for frequency acquisition. We develop a quadrant-switching analog Pl-loop that has the ability to track the frequency mismatch corresponding to full-rate frequency up to 35Gb/s. The 4-channel driver IC with this dual-loop hybrid CDR is fabricated in 0.13μm SiGe BiCMOS technology.

The chips were provided with electroless Ni bumps on which a layer of eutectic Au-Sn solder was deposited by meniscus soldering. The bonding of these bumps to the flexible substrate was performed by FPC technology, a laser bonding method. Mechanical stability between the tape and the chip was achieved by application of a low stress adhesive prior to bonding.

For substrates with multiple layers of conductive tracks, there is a need to realize contact positions on either side of the foil. Unfortunately, typical interconnection solutions such as electroplating used in the PCB industry, are not highly compatible with large area electronics processing technologies, such as roll-to-roll processing. In this paper, the authors present results on the development of a reliable front-to-backside interconnection technology by filling laser drilled through vias (TVs) in PEN foil with a silver-based conductive adhesive using optimized stencil printing methods. Typical initial resistances for 100 μm TVs are situated in a range of 0.4 to 0.5 Ω and TVs in a range of 0.15 to 0.35 Ω for 200 μm, respectively. Samples were subjected to various accelerated life time tests; 1,000 hours at 60˚C/90%RH, 1,000 hours at 85˚C/85% RH, 1,000 cycles at −40˚C/120˚C and 15,000 bending cycles using cylinders with 10 mm and 25 mm bending radius. Only the bending stress resulted in an increase in via resistance. Stress during bending was simulated using FE modeling and maximum stress positions were compared to SEM cross sections of the vias. To emphasize the robustness of this interconnection technology, a flexible demonstrator was successfully fabricated consisting of a 10 by 10 grid of LEDs on the front side, connected to photo diodes on the backside of the foil using 200 μm TVs for interconnection.","","978-2-9527-4671-7","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6698696","systems-in-foil;interconnection technology;through via;isotropic conductive adhesive (ICA);FE modeling","Stress;Resistance;Filling;Integrated circuit interconnections;Integrated circuit modeling;Reliability;Lasers","conductive adhesives;flexible electronics;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated optoelectronics;laser beam machining;life testing;light emitting diodes;photodiodes;printing;silver;three-dimensional integrated circuits","through via reliable filling;silver based conductive adhesive;flexible PEN substrate;low cost optimized stencil printing methods;systems-in-foil technology;large area organic electronics;interconnection solutions;front-to-backside interconnection technology;laser drilled through via;accelerated life time test;bending stress;LED;photodiodes;resistance 0.4 ohm to 0.5 ohm;resistance 0.15 ohm to 0.35 ohm;size 200 mum;Ag","","2","","6","","2 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Whether in the field of science and technology or in the technical aspects of human social life, optoelectronics has a huge impact and is increasingly complementing or replacing electronic systems. Targeting the optoelectronic components, such as laser diodes, light emitting diodes (LED) or photo diodes, packaging plays a crucial role for their use in various applications. In addition, with the growing demand for flexible circuits or systems, flexible packaging attracts more research interest. In this contribution we introduce a novel approach for realizing the packaging of commercially available optoelectronic components on flexible substrates. Here, a bare chip of a laser diode with a dimension of 300 x 250 x 100 m was employed. Its two electrodes are located in two opposite faces, thus generating a vertically flowing current. Considering the flexibility, we decided to use a polymer film as substrate material. In contrast to the state of the art for the packaging of laser diodes with the use of wire bonding technology, we fully adopted a new flip chip die bonding technique to accomplish the mechanical mounting and electrical connection. The key for realizing the entire packaging is employing a small-sized polymer carrier, which is partly metallized as a contact pad. The bare chip is firstly bonded on this polymer carrier with one electrode and then flipped down to be mounted on a large polymer substrate, which is designed as a circuit board to be connected with a power supply. Simultaneously, the other electrode mounted on this large substrate so far is electrically contacted as well. In this way, the bare chip of the laser diode is assembled on the flexible substrate by applying the new flip chip die bonding technique without any wire connections. The demand for developing this new flip chip bonding process instead of adopting the current flip chip technology derives from the selection of the used flexible substrate materials. By employing polymer films, we preferred to choose those with a higher transparency since their better optic characteristics enable much broader optical applications. However, those polymers have mostly a low glass transition temperature, thus a restricted thermal load is required during processing. In order to comply with this, we employed adhesives as bonding materials. For a further minimization of the thermal load we chose ultraviolet (UV)-curing adhesives and correspondingly designed an optode instead of the widely used thermode to cure the adhesives. This new process of adopting the optode is called optodic bonding, which was applied twice for contacting both electrodes of the laser diode to complete the packaging on the polymer substrate. We illustrate this novel approach and subsequently conduct a comparison of this new technique and the common technology applied for optoelectronic packaging. A first prototype of the packaged laser diode using this approach is produced and hereon presented.","2377-5726","978-1-4799-8609-5","10.1109/ECTC.2015.7159768","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7159768","","Packaging;Substrates;Bonding;Lamination;Flip-chip devices;Polymers;Diode lasers","chip scale packaging;curing;electrodes;flip-chip devices;integrated circuit bonding;integrated optics;lead bonding;optical films;optical polymers;optoelectronic devices;polymer films;semiconductor lasers","optode;optodic bonding;thermode;transition temperature;ultraviolet curing adhesives;thermal load;polymer films;circuit board;small-sized polymer carrier;electrical connection;mechanical mounting;flip chip die bonding technique;wire bonding technology;polymer film;vertically flowing current;electrodes;bare chip;flexible packaging;flexible circuits;photodiodes;LED;light emitting diodes;laser diodes;flip chip-based optodic bonding;flexible substrates;optoelectronic packaging;size 300 m;size 250 m;size 100 m","","","","12","","16 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

After cooling and solidification a welding bead on the substrate surface is formed. With this generation of circuit traces mechatronic devices can be built up, especially for high current power electronic applications.

These detectors are used in a large variety of scientific applications, ranging from high-speed optical astronomy and X-ray astronomy to the new X-ray Free Electron Laser sources. The main concept of VERITAS is to provide a flexible readout chip able to cope not only with different kinds of detectors, but also with a large set of operating conditions that may require very different noise thresholds and input dynamic ranges. These can vary by more than two orders of magnitude. Every analog channel of VERITAS provides a trapezoidal weighting function. This filtering strategy had never been applied to the pnCCD before. The very first measurements obtained coupling VERITAS with a 128 × 256 pnCCD are shown. With a readout time of 4 μs/line a noise of 3.9 electrons has been measured in the highest gain mode. The resolution obtained on the Mn-Kα peak of a 55Fe source is 136 eV for single events. A noise of 30 electrons has been achieved in the lowest gain mode at a speed of 6.4 μs/line. In this low gain setting an input charge up to 2 5 × 105 electrons can be processed. These striking results fulfill the requirements of the main foreseen applications of large-size pnCCDs. In order to further improve the performance and the flexibility of the ASIC, a second version based on a fully differential architecture has been designed. The new topology allows one also to switch with the same ASIC between the source follower and drain current readout of the DEPFET sensors and to reach a processing time of about 2-3 μs/line with an electronics noise ≤10 el. For this reason the second version of VERITAS is very attractive for the proposed ESA X-ray astronomy mission ATHENA.","1558-1578","","10.1109/TNS.2012.2228410","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6410464","DEPFET;low-noise amplifiers;mixed analog digital integrated circuits;noise filtering;pnCCD;readout ASIC;silicon radiation detectors;spectroscopy;X-ray detectors;X-ray free electron lasers;X-ray imaging","Noise;Application specific integrated circuits;Switches;Dynamic range;Sensors;Anodes;X-ray lasers","application specific integrated circuits;flexible electronics;free electron lasers;X-ray imaging;X-ray lasers","128-channel ASIC;VERITAS;pnCCD readout;DEPFET arrays;X-ray imaging;spectroscopy;XFEL;versatile readout;integrated trapezoidal analog shapers;MPI-Halbleiterlabor;Munich;high-speed optical astronomy;X-ray astronomy;X-ray free electron laser sources;flexible readout chip;analog channel;trapezoidal weighting function;filtering strategy;differential architecture;source follower;drain current readout;DEPFET sensors","","17","","14","","14 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Here, the precise thermal management and the exact magnetic-field control of the physics package are required for accurate clocks. Also, high thermal resistance for the physics package helps to considerably reduce power consumption of the CSAC. Thus, in this study, a compact physics package with embedded magnetic shielding has been developed by using flexible hybrid approach for a chip-scale atomic clock. The vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) and the MEMS hotplate on a flexible circuit board (FPCB) are vertically stacked and bound with a QWP and a MEMS vapor cell by aluminum foil. The aluminum bound structure is suspended by the polyimide core of the FPCB for high thermal resistance. Also, the mu-metal fixture is applied for magnetic shield and FPCB suspension, while the MEMS hotplate with a resistance heater and an amorphous Si based thermistor is adopted for thermal management of the physics package. Then, the planar integrated FPCB is folded and stacked vertically at an intersection with the mu-metal fixture. As a result, the CSAC incorporating the proposed physics package reveals the CPT linewidth of 5.6 kHz and low power consumption of about 200mW. The measured frequency short-term stability is about 5.2×10-12 τ-1/2 at 1000-second integration.

The trend towards extreme thinning of device wafers in WLP processes is driving the need for temporary carrier technology. With the advantages of large area, non-contact, high efficiency and controllability, laser debonding technology has become an emerging key technology in the semiconductor industry. Because the redistribution layer is immediately on top of the debonding layer, minimizing the forces during debonding is critical to maintaining the integrity of ultrathin wafers. However, slight device damage and degradation of device characteristics during laser debonding remain unsolved due to the laser-induced transient high temperature and shock wave effects. Herein, we demonstrate a novel non-destructive laser debonding process for advanced WLP by rationally designing responsive layers, buffer layers, and bonding layers. The research results show that the decomposition of a-Si:H in the response layer can be selectively induced by UV laser to generate molten polysilicon and release H2 rapidly. The resulting shock wave effect rapidly expands the exfoliation layer, effectively separating the device wafer from the glass carrier. During laser debonding, the buffer layer compensates for internal stress, thermal damage, and optical damage, protecting the ultra-thin device wafer from any structural damage (such as cracks, chips, or stick marks) caused by transient high temperatures and shock waves. By precisely controlling the input of laser energy and designing appropriate response layers and buffer layers, ultra-thin device wafers can be protected from any structural damage, making them highly possible in the field of advanced integrated circuit and conformal chip array manufacturing. We believe that these encouraging results motivate us to make a leap forward in the field of advanced flexible electronic packaging.","","978-1-6654-9905-7","10.1109/ICEPT56209.2022.9873356","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9873356","temporary bonding/debonding;laser debonding;structural design;wafer level packaging","Buffer layers;Shock waves;Semiconductor lasers;Packaging;Thermal conductivity;Wafer scale integration;Manufacturing","laser materials processing;shock wave effects;wafer bonding;wafer level packaging","laser-induced transient high temperature;shock wave effects;buffer layers;UV laser;exfoliation layer;buffer layer compensates;structural damage;laser energy;advanced integrated circuit;conformal chip array manufacturing;advanced flexible electronic packaging;semiconductor industry;automotive advancements;advanced wafer-level packaging processes;ultrathin device;temporary carrier technology;redistribution layer;ultrathin wafers;laser debonding layer technology;advanced WLP processes;nondestructive laser debonding process","","","","9","IEEE","9 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Design relations are given for the lengths of an arbitrary number of branches, for the selectivity near the peak response, for the wavelength interval to the nearest undesired peak, and for tuning changes in the various branches. It is shown that an MBR is not sensitive to amplitude differences of the order of 20% between the branches, but requires phase control in order to achieve tuning to a specific wavelength. The effects of semiconductor gain variation with wavelength are obtained from a rate-equation solution including MBR. By changing the semiconductor temperature (gain peak) at the same time as the MBR is tuned, a broad range of tuning without jumps is achievable.<>","1558-2213","","10.1109/50.19093","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=19093","","Frequency;Laser tuning;Integrated optics;Optical sensors;Optical variables control;Photonic integrated circuits;Tunable circuits and devices;Reflectivity;Phase control;Temperature distribution","integrated optics;laser tuning;optical elements;semiconductor junction lasers","multibranch frequency-selective reflector;tunable single-mode semiconductor lasers;flexible wavelength-selective element;optical integrated circuits;reflectivity;MBR;phase control;semiconductor gain variation","","6","2","15","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Their electromechanical reliability has been studied, yet very few studies report their thermoelectric behavior. We report the current carrying capacity of an inkjet-printed nano-silver interconnects on mesoporous PET substrate. For this study, the printed interconnects are approximately 100 μm wide, with two different thicknesses: single layer (~650 nm thick) and double layer (~1 μm thick). Samples were sintered with different parameters of oven and laser sintering. The effect of printing and curing parameters on the trace current-carrying capability is evaluated with and without the presence of an encapsulation layer. At the current sweep range of 0.005-0.08A for single layer traces and 0.005-0.17A for double layer traces, results show that the trace resistance slightly increases and then decreases to a minimal value smaller than the initial resistance before dramatically increases indicating substrate damage. The double-layer traces withstand higher current and reach higher temperature than the substrate glass transition point. The oven sintered traces have higher initial resistance than laser sintered samples reflecting the difference in the percentage of solvent content and the microstructure. A drastic decrease in resistance is noticed at low current for the oven sintered samples, but at higher current, both oven and laser sintered traces showed similar behavior. The printed encapsulation layer did not significantly impact the trace behavior. A thermoelectric simulation of the trace joule heating was generated in order to quantify the thermal energy transmitted to the surrounding environment and capture the temperature of the trace surface. The model was compared to the experimental results and showed a good correlation.","2377-5726","978-1-6654-7943-1","10.1109/ECTC51906.2022.00131","Air Force Research Laboratory; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9816636","Inkjet printing;current carrying capacity;flexible electronics;joule heating;mesoporous PET","Resistance;Encapsulation;Ovens;Sintering;Laser sintering;Glass;Mesoporous materials","curing;electrical resistivity;encapsulation;flexible electronics;glass transition;ink jet printing;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit reliability;laser sintering;silver;thermal conductivity","current carrying capacity;inkjet-printed nanosilver interconnects;mesoporous PET substrate;flexible hybrid electronic device;printed interconnects;laser sintering;curing parameters;trace current-carrying capability;current sweep range;single layer traces;double layer traces;trace resistance;substrate damage;double-layer traces;substrate glass transition point;higher initial resistance;laser sintered samples;oven sintered samples;printed encapsulation layer;trace behavior;trace joule heating;trace surface;electromechanical reliability;thermoelectric simulation;size 100.0 mum;size 650.0 nm;size 1.0 mum;wavelength 0.005 A to 0.17 A","","","","24","IEEE","12 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Low temperature solders are finding increasing applications, primarily when polymeric materials are involved in the assembly process.

Hence, it is necessary to develop an understanding of the structure-property relationship, both after reflow and after long term use, in these alternate solders. The solder microstructure in an SMT joint and the reflow characteristics are influenced by a variety of factors, including solder composition, reflow parameters such as temperature and dwell time, other process variables, subsequent temperature exposure, etc. In this study, two different solders, Pb-Sn-Bi solder and Pb-Sn-Ag solder, have been used to surface mount various components on a polyester substrate using various process conditions. The solder joint microstructures have been examined using cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy. The effects of some of the process variables on the solder microstructure are outlined. Differences between the behaviour of the solders are also highlighted.

Although the conventional two thin-film transistor (2-TFT) AMOLED voltage-programmed pixel circuit (VPPC) can provide high resolution and high yield, the 2-TFT VPPC is prone to image retention over time due to shift in the threshold voltage (VT-shift) of a-Si:H TFTs. This paper presents a new driving scheme that not only preserves the simplicity of the 2-TFT VPPC, but also demonstrates high uniformity. Experimental results indicate that the current drop in the new driving scheme is less than 11% after 15 days of operation whereas it is over 50% for the conventional driving scheme.

However, the thin PI film will suffer burnthrough of the film under the required high energy density to form graphene. Herein, we introduced an auxiliary cooling semiconductor plate beneath the PI substrate to decrease the temperature of the substrate to reduce the burnt thickness. Experiment results showed that the burnt thickness will decrease to about 33.39 μm for -2°C on the thin film with thickness about 12 μm and the value of resistance can still be kept at 8.33 k Ω. The effects of the scanning speed and power on the size of the wire also discussed.

One way to achieve this goal is to embed the thinned die into two dielectric films, which results in a flexible ultrathin chip package (UTCP). This paper describes a new UTCP process flow with microvia formation by standard UV lithography through photosensitive polyimide (PSPI). Such microvia-formation method proved to be more reliable than laser drilling techniques and simpler than a dry etching process. Since the used PSPI is self-priming, a thin layer of potassium chloride was introduced as a release layer. In the end, the polyimide encapsulation of the thinned die can be released from the carrier substrate and becomes a flexible chip package with a total thickness of around 50 μm. Daisy-chain test dies were encapsulated inside spin-coated polyimide films. Excellent chip-to-package interconnection was demonstrated by electrical daisy chain and contact resistance measurements. Bending tests and thermal cycling tests were also performed on the daisy-chain test vehicles. Desired flexibility and reliability of UTCPs was observed.","2156-3985","","10.1109/TCPMT.2012.2188402","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6175934","Chip embedding;flexible;system in package;thinned chip","Polyimides;Glass;Curing;Substrates;Bonding","chip scale packaging;contact resistance;dielectric thin films;encapsulation;flexible electronics;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit testing;polymers;spin coating;system-in-package;ultraviolet lithography","flexible ultrathin chip package;photosensitive polyimide;thinned die;electronic products;dielectric films;UTCP process flow;standard UV lithography;PSPI;microvia-formation method;laser drilling techniques;dry etching process;potassium chloride thin layer;polyimide encapsulation;carrier substrate;flexible chip package;spin-coated polyimide films;chip-to-package interconnection;electrical daisy chain;contact resistance measurements;bending tests;thermal cycling tests;daisy-chain test vehicles","","23","","16","IEEE","3 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

If the PON system could handle multi-bit-rate packets, the user could choose the type of Optical Network Unit (ONU) needed making it easy to accommodate multiple users.

This machine can place and simultaneously reflow solder balls of various materials and diameters. The IZM mould and assembly line was installed to offer small/medium sized production to industry. This center can also be used for package development. In this paper, recent applications such as mechatronics and combination of multichip flip chip processes on different carriers including encapsulation by moulding are demonstrated. For production of CSPs and tape-BGA, the fiber-push connection method was used as a key technology. All packages are subject to detailed reliability investigations. The paper focuses on the moisture sensitivity of underfill and moulding compounds. Results of accelerated aging tests and the failure mechanisms for chip scale packages and few-chip micro-BGAs are demonstrated. Improvements for processing conditions and material selection and design are discussed, in order to achieve packages with high reliability for harsh environmental conditions in automotive use.","","0-7803-3865-0","10.1109/PEP.1997.656468","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=656468","","Semiconductor device packaging;Production;Flip chip;Plastic packaging;Bonding;Lead;Packaging machines;Electronics industry;Europe;Large-scale systems","integrated circuit reliability;plastic packaging;integrated circuit packaging;surface mount technology;flip-chip devices;reflow soldering;mechatronics;ageing;life testing;integrated circuit testing;encapsulation;moisture;laser materials processing;laser beam machining;lead bonding;automotive electronics","flexible moulding;reliability;CSP;BGA-packages;interconnection technology;semiconductor industry;plastic packaging line design;prototyping;low scale packaging;epoxy multi-chip die bonder;wire bonder;flip chip placement system;multi-plunger moulding system;laser marking/trimming station;lead forming;lead soldering;solder ball placement;flip chips;ball grid array packages;laser solder ball placer;reflow solder balls;IZM mould/assembly line;package development;mechatronics;multichip flip chip processes;moulding encapsulation;CSPs;tape-BGA;fiber-push connection method;moisture sensitivity;underfill;moulding compounds;accelerated aging tests;failure mechanisms;chip scale packages;few-chip micro-BGAs;harsh environmental conditions;automotive use","","3","","11","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our on-chip comb has five lines spaced at 20 GHz with a high tone-to-noise ratio of about 40 dB after one stage optical amplification. Our back-to-back transmission achieves bit error rates (BERs) well below 2e-2, the threshold for 20% overhead forward error correction (FEC), for 800 Gb/s using 16-GBd 32QAM on five WDM channels.

We present results of prototype arrays fabricated with laser micromachining. A custom made flexible printed circuit fanout was patterned using laser lithography and chemical etching. Miniaturization for packaging in an endoscope was achieved by aligning and fixing the fanout along its thickness direction to the array elements.

A mass spring matching layer and a quarter wavelength matching layer were vacuum deposited to improve sensitivity. Prototype 20-element transducer arrays operating at 66 MHz center frequency were fabricated and characterized. Electrical impedance measurements show that all elements of the array were connected and agree with simulations. Pulse-echo measurements after deposition of matching layers show a two-way fractional bandwidth of 62%, a significant improvement over the 40% bandwidth with no matching layers.

Several tasks requiring high precision and reproducibility must be automated. In the context of secure Integrated Circuits (ICs) characterization, tasks such as power analysis are commonly automated. However, very few automations exist for tools calibration, while recent characterization schemes encounter mechanical constraints. Computer vision, flexible tool used in various fields, gives opportunities to address these constraints. In the case of laser fault injections, several positioning adjustments are required to ensure a maximal energy transmission in a targeted point. An accurate focalization of the laser beam is reached by using an autofocus system. Such a system is obtained by analyzing the camera view of the IC in the time-frequency domain. Whatever the method to disturb an IC, every secure characterization should be reproducible. By exploiting computer vision assistance, fault injection can be automated by mixing vision techniques to build a full or partial view of an IC and automatically identify the targeted IC and focus the perturbation on a chosen pattern in the image. A reliable pattern detection is implemented by studying spatial consistency of image’s remarkable features represented by graphs.

On the way to implement more and more components in foil, the Chip-Film Patch (CFP) technology is developed by exploiting the adaptive layout technique. CFP is based on CMOS compatible tools and processes, thus exploiting the advantages and establishments of scaled CMOS technologies. In this paper, a HySiF based on CFP technology is demonstrated through embedding and interconnection of two commercial CMOS chips. Any misalignment of the embedded chips is compensated by a smart lithography step using a laser direct writing tool that allows pattern recognition and layout adjustments by an adaptive layout technique. This leads to higher I/O counts and smaller pad sizes. All processing steps are discussed and, in the end, the process is verified by electrical verification of the micro-controller and NFC chips.","","978-1-5386-6814-6","10.1109/ESTC.2018.8546380","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8546380","Adaptive layout;Chip-Film Patch (CFP);Polyimide PI2611;Ultra-Thin Chips;Hybrid System-in-Foil (HySiF)","Polyimides;Etching;Layout;Metals;Lithography;Semiconductor device measurement","CMOS integrated circuits;consumer electronics;elemental semiconductors;flexible electronics;integrated circuit layout;integrated circuit reliability;laser materials processing;multichip modules;photolithography;polymer films;sensors;silicon","microcontroller;Internet of Things;IoT;electrical verification;I/O counts;embedded chip misalignment;chip-film patch technology;consumer electronics;multichip patch;adaptive layout technique;high performance silicon chips;ultra-thin chips;HySiF;Hybrid System-in-Foil;smart systems;More-than-Moore;microelectronic developments;flexible sensor systems;low stress polymer foils;NFC chips;layout adjustments;pattern recognition;laser direct writing tool;smart lithography step;commercial CMOS chips;CFP technology;scaled CMOS technologies;Si","","10","","16","","29 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It was demonstrated, that the XUV pulses can be compressed not far from their Fourier limit. The XAC design provide for an intermediate focal plane (IFP) where the pulse is spectrally dispersed, allowing for spectral phase manipulation. Inserting an adaptive optical component at the IFP provides a flexible control of the pulse spectral phase for compression as well as pulse shaping. In this work we test the applicability of this adaptive pulse shaper on high-order harmonic attosecond pulses calculated in the strong field approximation using the saddlepoint method . We also compare the compression achievable with XAC to that results obtained with metallic filters.","","978-1-4244-4079-5","10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2009.5196323","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5196323","","Pulse compression methods;Optical pulse shaping;Optical pulses;Gas lasers;Solid lasers;Optical pulse generation;Delay;Tunable circuits and devices;Gratings;Programmable control","focal planes;Fourier transform optics;laser beams;monochromators;optical design techniques;optical pulse compression;optical pulse shaping;ultraviolet spectra","adaptive compressor design;pulse-shaper;attosecond XUV pulse;nonlinear interaction;femtosecond laser pulse;far generate attosecond pulse;monochromator;negative group delay dispersion;grating separation;Fourier limit;intermediate focal plane;adaptive optical component;pulse spectral phase compression;spectral phase pulse shaping;strong field approximation;saddlepoint method;metallic filter","","","","9","","7 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

WSIs present a desirable compact sensor as possible with Fabry Perot interferometers (FPIs), with the additional benefits of strong visibility contrast and high sensitivity to external parameters as expected with Mach-Zehnder interferometers. Theoretical models and finite-difference time-domain simulations show the WSI spectral responses to be 2χ to 120χ more sensitive to changes in refractive index, temperature, and strain over comparable Bragg grating waveguides and FPIs. Femtosecond laser irradiation with selective chemical etching provided the flexible means for 3-D geometric structuring and waveguide integration below the surface, delivering precise WSIs with a small '12-nm rms surface roughness.

We simulated the possibility of employing the micrometer-scale InP on insulator to realize electrically driven lasers and found that the metal induced optical loss is negligible when the InP dimension exceeds 4.0 μm.

With the aim of wearable application of photoacoustic technique, we propose a miniaturized photoacoustic 3D imager for superficial medical imaging. By employing the compact continuous-wave laser diode based optical irradiation and an ultrathin 2D matrix array based photoacoustic detection in the coherent frequency domain, a wearable imaging probe with a size of about 80 × 25 × 24 mm3 and a weight of 21 g is developed. At the backend, an FPGA controlled Howland current source drives the laser diodes to excite linear frequency modulated optical irradiation. Recorded by a portable multichannel data acquisition system, the generated photoacoustic responses are firstly compressed with the coherent frequency domain photoacoustic method and then extrapolated in the wavenumber-frequency domain for fast image reconstruction. With three-wavelength (450 nm, 638 nm, and 808 nm) laser irradiation, photoacoustic imaging can be operated multispectrally, endowing the developed imager with functional imaging capability in 3D space. With the imager worn on the human forearm, hemoglobin oxygen saturation level in superficial arm vasculature can be long-term monitored with high stability. When the imager is applied for imaging in a relatively large area (e.g., early melanoma detection in the human breast), flexible scanning in a handheld manner can be performed. This work opens the application potential of photoacoustic technique in a broad range of areas, including personalized healthcare, home health monitoring, and long-term physiologic monitoring.","1940-9990","","10.1109/TBCAS.2019.2940243","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8827643","Photoacoustic imaging;portable imaging system;wearable imaging","Biomedical optical imaging;Optical imaging;Diode lasers;Optical reflection;Radiation effects;Semiconductor lasers","biomedical optical imaging;biomedical ultrasonics;cancer;data acquisition;frequency modulation;health care;image reconstruction;laser applications in medicine;medical image processing;patient monitoring;photoacoustic effect;semiconductor lasers","human breast;melanoma detection;superficial arm vasculature;laser irradiation;linear frequency modulated optical irradiation;continuous-wave laser diode based optical irradiation;miniaturized 3D imager;home health monitoring;photoacoustic imaging;image reconstruction;wavenumber-frequency domain;coherent frequency domain photoacoustic method;generated photoacoustic responses;portable multichannel data acquisition system;laser diodes;wearable imaging probe;photoacoustic detection;ultrathin 2D matrix array;superficial medical imaging;wearable application;personalized home-based system;hospital-based system;medical monitoring;wearable healthcare;wavelength 450.0 nm;wavelength 638.0 nm;wavelength 808.0 nm","Diagnostic Imaging;Equipment Design;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Miniaturization;Phantoms, Imaging;Photoacoustic Techniques;Wearable Electronic Devices","7","","27","IEEE","9 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recently, organic-lead halide perovskite semiconductors (CH3NH3PbX3 with X = Cl, Br, I), with high optical absorption coefficient, optimal direct band gap, and long electron/hole diffusion lengths, good optical properties and long electron hole diffusion length, which ensure adequate gain and efficient optical feedback, have become a research hotspot to achieve semiconductor lasers. Up to now, both Fabry-Perot (FP) lasing and Whispering Gallery Mode (WGM) lasing have been observed in perovskite micro-cavities, such as microwires, hexagonal microplates and square microdisks. However, the lasing mechanism is fixed once the perovskite microcavity is synthesized. Here the transition between FP lasing and WGM lasing is demonstrated in perovskite microwires and moreover, the transition is reversible without any damage to the samples. The CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite microwires are synthesized with one-step solution based self-assembled method and the typical lengths are tens of microns with an aspect ratio about 1 in the transverse plane. When perovskite microwire on glass substrate is pumped uniformly above threshold, FP lasing action can be observed which oscillates between the two end facets along the microwire axial direction. By repositioning the microwire on a perovskite block with one end suspending in the air or placing a perovskite block on one end of the microwire via micromanipulation, the FP lasing mode can be suppressed. In such case, single mode lasing can be excited when the suspending end of the microwire is pumped. After transferring the microwire to glass substrate again, FP lasing can be observed when pumped uniformly. Numerical simulations show that the perovskite block induces huge leaky loss to the microwire, which suppresses the FP lasing mode. As the lasing modes corresponds to the high quality (Q) modes, WGM modes exhibit larger Q factor than the FP modes in the transverse plane. Therefore, the single mode lasing originates from WGM mode in the transverse plane when the FP modes are suppressed. By introducing perovskite blocks, transition between FP lasing in the microwire axial direction and WGM lasing in the transverse plane can be achieved without any damage to the sample. The proposed mechanism provides a simple and flexible way to tailor the perovskite lasing actions, exhibiting potential applications in integrated photonic circuits and light sources.","","978-1-5090-6093-1","10.1109/PIERS.2016.7734835","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7734835","","Optical feedback;Optical pumping;Optical refraction;Optical variables control;Geometrical optics;Laser feedback","absorption coefficients;integrated optics;laser cavity resonators;laser feedback;laser modes;micro-optics;optical losses;organic semiconductors;Q-factor;refractive index;semiconductor lasers;whispering gallery modes","reversible transition;FP lasing;Fabry-Perot lasing;WGM;whispering gallery mode;perovskite microwires;semiconductor microwires;geometric uniformities;optical gain;refractive index;microscale electronic building blocks;microscale optoelectronic building blocks;semiconductor lasers;organic-lead halide perovskite semiconductors;optical absorption coefficient;direct band gap;electron hole diffusion length;optical properties;optical feedback;microcavities;hexagonal microplates;square microdisks;self-assembled method;lasing mode;glass substrate;leaky loss;high quality modes;Q factor;transverse plane;integrated photonic circuits;light sources","","","","","","10 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because of the flexible characteristic, the package can be attached to a flat, curve surface and even a dynamic surface. It is important to provide protection of ultra-thin semiconductor chip and integrate these chips with flexible substrate. The aim of this paper is to develop an ultra-thin film package (UTFP) which can be bended easily. This technology which has highly potential for miniaturization of the electronic system can be realized by means of embedding ultra-thin components into flexible materials. Successful embedding of ultra-thin chips with 18um thickness and testing results are shown. To use a 3um Cu layer with 18um carrier film as a base, solder balls were formed on a laser-hatched Cu layer which has better wettability than other area without laser hatching. By flip-chip method, ultra-thin chips can be directly assembled. It is necessary to do dry plasma treatment to enhance the chips' strength for ultra-thin chip manufacturing. Subsequently, chips were embedded into flexible organic material. With proper embedded material chose, it can make this UTFP bendable and provide functions of support and protection. After carrier film was removed and metallization process was done, an ultra-thin and highly flexible package with embedded chip was carried out. The electrical path were connected together to form daisy chain structure for electrical measurement. The total thickness of this package is less then 100um and it can be easily bended to 10mm bending curvature radius without any cracks. Not only the UTFP process was developed, but also some testing methods were executed to examine the reliability of package, such as TCT (Thermal cycling test) and THST (thermal & humidity storage test). Good flexible property of single UTFP has been verified in our previous study. Furthermore, the ultra-thin chip package is assembled on a flexible substrate with ACP (Anisotropic Conductive Paste) and some bending tests were performed. This package with flexible substrate connected has passed the static bending test for 200 hours and dynamic bending test for 1000 cycles under 10mm bending curvature radius. The process details on each core technique will be disclosed, and some test results will be presented in the paper.","2150-5942","978-1-4244-9786-7","10.1109/IMPACT.2010.5699606","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5699606","","Substrates;Stacking;Resistance;Bonding;Films;Copper","electronics packaging;integrated circuits;materials testing;reliability;substrates;thermal analysis;thin films","ultra-thin film packages;flexible electronic system package technology;flexible application;flexible characteristic;curve surface;dynamic surface;ultra-thin semiconductor chip;flexible substrate;miniaturization;ultra-thin components;flexible materials;ultra-thin chips;laser-hatched Cu layer;laser hatching;flip-chip method;dry plasma treatment;ultra-thin chip manufacturing;flexible organic material;carrier film;metallization process;ultra-thin flexible package;highly flexible package;embedded chip;electrical path;daisy chain structure;electrical measurement;bending curvature radius;cracks;UTFP process;package reliability;thermal cycling test;thermal storage test;humidity storage test;ultra-thin chip package;anisotropic conductive paste;static bending test;dynamic bending test","","4","","7","","20 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The entire package is 645 /spl mu/m thick, including a 550 /spl mu/m-thick chip and a 85 /spl mu/m-thick tape carrier. For interconnection and redistribution of the chip I/Os, a three layer tape with gold or gold/nickel surface finish on the copper layer is used. Mechanical stability between the tape and the chip is achieved using a low stress adhesive. 63Sn/37Pb solder balls on the bottom side enable CSP attach to the board. For assembly, a new manufacturing line is established. The IC bumping process is done at wafer level. A very cost effective pretreatment method is to coat the Al IC pads with electroless Ni/Au. Besides the cost advantage of this process, a very high layer uniformity and a near hermetic sealing of the Al-pad is achieved. Subsequently, a novel process is used to apply a 10 /spl mu/m-thin layer of AuSn20 solder to the Ni pads on the wafer. Interconnection of the bare die to the flex interposer is performed with a reel-to-reel chip-on-flex laser bonder. This bonder has the option to use a single fibre or multifibre bondhead. With the multifibre bondhead, the high speed bonder can be implemented in a fully-automatic production line. The advantage of this bonder system is the capability of bonding through the flex tape. Solder balls for CSP attach to the board are applied using a fluxless system for solder ball placement and controlled laser reflow. The package is fully surface mount compatible, allowing a wide process window.","","0-7803-4850-8","10.1109/ICMCM.1998.670803","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=670803","","Wafer bonding;Gold;Nickel;Chip scale packaging;Integrated circuit interconnections;Costs;Pulp manufacturing;Flexible electronics;Surface finishing;Copper","integrated circuit packaging;surface mount technology;mechanical stability;adhesion;seals (stoppers);microassembling;reflow soldering;laser materials processing;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit metallisation","F/sup 2/-cPAC chip size package;manufacturing process;low cost CSP;manufacturing line;chip-size package;flex circuit interposer;package thickness;tape carrier;chip I/O interconnection;chip I/O redistribution;gold surface finish;gold/nickel surface finish;copper layer;mechanical stability;multilayer tape interconnection;low stress adhesive;SnPb solder balls;CSP attach;assembly;wafer level IC bumping process;cost effective pretreatment method;Al IC pads;electroless Ni/Au coating;layer uniformity;hermetic sealing;AuSn solder;Ni pads;bare die/flex interposer interconnection;reel-to-reel chip-on-flex laser bonder;multifibre bondhead;single fibre bondhead;automatic production line;flex tape;solder balls;fluxless system;solder ball placement;controlled laser reflow;surface mount compatibility;process window;645 micron;550 micron;85 micron;10 micron;Au-Cu;Ni-Au-Cu;Cu;Al;AuSn-Ni-Au-Al;SnPb","","1","","13","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Packaging of optoelectronic components and modules ensures the reliable performance in mechanical, electrical, and optical properties. As the demand for a mechanical flexibility of optoelectronic packaging and also for a lower manufacturing budget is continuously growing, cost-effective transparent polymer foils are becoming more favored. They are employed for establishing novel planar optronic systems, which are applied as high-integrated sensing networks. In this contribution, we choose a bare edge-emitting laser diode as the light source for the optronic sensor systems and mainly investigate its optical performance in the chip-level packaging directly onto polymeric carrier substrates. Since these materials with low glass transition temperatures require thermal-restricted processes, we adopt previously developed optodic bonding utilizing light energy instead of heat energy to accomplish the chip-level packaging of the laser diode. However, the heat dissipation of the active optoelectronic components constitutes one of the most critical issues in their packaging technologies, even more severe because of the extreme low thermal conductivity of the employed polymer foils. Addressing this challenge, packaging of the laser diode die directly on the conventional substrate FR4 for printed circuit boards without any thermal management is attempted as a reference for packaging onto flex polymeric foils. The optical output power and the heat accumulation behavior in the form of the temperature of the active laser diode onto both substrates are measured and continuously monitored. Heat dissipation approaches based on accelerating the dissipation speed and reducing the heat accumulation are investigated.","2156-3985","","10.1109/TCPMT.2016.2543028","German Research Foundation within the framework of the Collaborative Research Center Transregio 123, Planar Optronic Systems; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7450182","Flexible optoelectronic packaging;heat dissipation;low-temperature bonding;transparent polymer foils;UV curable adhesives.;Flexible optoelectronic packaging;heat dissipation;low-temperature bonding;transparent polymer foils;UV curable adhesives","Packaging;Diode lasers;Substrates;Heating;Polymers;Optical sensors;Electronic packaging thermal management","chip scale packaging;glass transition;polymer films;semiconductor lasers;thermal conductivity","chip-level packaging;low-cost transparent polymer foil substrates;optodic bonding;optoelectronic industry;optoelectronic component packaging;optical properties;electrical properties;mechanical properties;manufacturing budget;high-integrated sensing networks;bare edge-emitting laser diode;optronic sensor systems;polymeric carrier substrates;optical performance;low glass transition temperatures;thermal-restricted processes;light energy;extreme low thermal conductivity;substrate FR4;printed circuit boards;heat accumulation behavior;optical output power;heat dissipation approaches;light source","","4","","19","IEEE","8 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To facilitate debugging of the first silicon, diagnosis of yield issues, and to enable repair processes, an accurate defect isolation is needed with support of advanced test, diagnostic, and yield analysis tools. Laser voltage imaging (LVI), laser voltage probing (LVP), and electron-beam testing are popular diagnostic techniques for scan chain failures. As scan remains instrumental in developing more advanced DFT technologies, its reliable operations are essential for test pattern bring-up, failure analysis, and yield learning. Running LVI tests at early stages of a design process involves a sophisticated infrastructure to offer a nanometer diagnostic resolution with a non-destructive failure isolation. However, as the use of external testers may not be feasible besides providing power and clock signals, the paper demonstrates how to reuse on-chip EDT compression environment to generate and apply LVI-aware scan patterns for advanced contactless test procedures. The presented approach avoids the repetitive loading of scan chains, requires no seed patterns to encode LVI tests, has virtually no area overhead, and offers a flexible selection of non-toggling scan chains in a low power test mode. Furthermore, there are no constraints or requirements imposed by designs that could limit the applicability of the scheme. The proposed solution does not compromise the test compression performance, marked by test data reduction ratios, test coverage, and test time. Hence, there are no modifications needed in existing flows and tools to implement the method besides the use of recommended polynomials.","2168-6750","","10.1109/TETC.2019.2944590","Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education(grant numbers:08/81/DSPB/8133); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8859228","E-beam test;laser voltage imaging;logic BIST;repeated scan integrity tests;scan cell diagnosis;test compression","Transistors;Failure analysis;Silicon;System-on-chip;Imaging;Clocks;Laser beams","design for testability;failure analysis;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit testing;integrated circuit yield;logic testing;semiconductor industry","autonomous scan patterns;semiconductor industry;design capabilities;test quality;management challenges;yield issues;repair processes;accurate defect isolation;advanced test;laser voltage probing;electron-beam testing;popular diagnostic techniques;scan chain failures;advanced DFT technologies;test pattern;failure analysis;yield learning;design process;nanometer diagnostic resolution;nondestructive failure isolation;clock signals;on-chip EDT compression environment;LVI-aware scan patterns;advanced contactless test procedures;seed patterns;LVI tests;nontoggling scan chains;low power test mode;test compression performance;test data reduction ratios;test coverage;laser voltage imaging","","","","26","IEEE","4 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The technology is based on wafer level packaging processes such as electro chemical metal deposition as well as deposition and structuring of polymeric interlayer dielectrics to create multi-layer wiring at rigid carrier wafers. The flex circuits are created subsequently by laser assisted detach of the multi-layer stack from the carrier wafers, which can be performed at full area or partially to create flex or rigid-flex configurations. The base technology enables line pitches down to 24 μm and staggered via configurations in a stack-up of up to three internal routing layers as well as front and back side contacts with minimum pitch of 55 μm. Depending on the layer stack-up total flex thicknesses between 20 and 50 μm are possible. The advanced technology enables line pitches of 14 μm and stacked via configurations with minimum via diameters of 10 μm in 10 μm thick polymer layers and a minimum pitch of the front and back side IOs of 27 μm. A further extension of the base technology allows the embedding of ultra-thin ICs into the multi-layer stack-up. The dices are 20 μm thin and placed in face-up configuration onto a die bonding adhesive. The thin ICs are then over coated with the next polymer layer and thus embedded into the thin film multilayer stack. As one demonstrator an acceleration and vibration sensor system was build. The demonstrator includes 2 ultra-thin sensor chips which are embedded in a 50 μm thick RDL layer stack on a rigid carrier.

The elementary microcone diodes differ electrically in their barrier height, which is modelled as a gaussian distribution. The circuit simulation software Advanced Design System (ADS) is used to analyze the rectification abilities of the overall structure. The results show that a distributed barrier height leads to a smoother IV-characteristic, which can also be interpreted as an aggregated diode with a smaller turn on voltage.

With the method of multiple cycles of deposition and cooling, this system demonstrated the deposition of thick copper film on flexible substrates at substrate temperature less than 120 °C. The thickness and cooling rate for one cycle are ~800 nm and 0.5 °C/s, respectively. Additionally, the processes of deposition and cooling are parallel in our system. By redesigning the mechanical structure of substrate carrier, the effect of the thermal stress change of substrate carrier on thinned glass substrates is minimized; therefore, our system can uniformly deposited ITO film on large-size thinned glass substrates.

Field strength loss due to demagnetization makes it necessary to remove the insertion device from the tunnel for inspection and repair, which brings several inconveniences. We aimed to develop an in situ radiation damage detection system for undulators capable of diagnosing relative field changes of 10-4 (100 ppm) or smaller. The system measures the flux change in a flexible printed circuit board coil attached to the undulator magnet array by periodically measuring the integral flux change during the opening and closing of the undulator gap. If the magnet block damage occurs, the signal from the coil will decrease proportionally to the damage. First tests performed on variable gap hybrid undulators for the Linac Coherent Light Source II (LCLS-II) at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory showed that the system is capable of measuring flux changes with a relative precision of approximately 0.7 × 10-4 over several days. Relative field changes smaller than 10-4 were detected in short-term measurements.

PCB manufacturers are being challenged to produce boards with smaller feature sizes using advanced processing techniques to allow for the use of current advanced packages. One solution to the circuit density requirement is to reduce the diameter of the via and the associated pad at the design phase, but maintain producibility at board fabrication. Advances in both material and processing capabilities have made flex materials an attractive alternative for use on low cost MCM-L applications. This paper describes and compares two methods of producing micro-vias in flexible laminate materials. Data collected to compare the two methods is presented to determine if there is a difference in the reliability of laser versus plasma formed micro-vias. An actual application for a tactical missile electronics module that incorporates micro-vias on flex based materials is discussed, along with how the micro-via approach helped accomplish the required wiring density. Several other examples of how the incorporation of MCM-L technology with micro-vias enabled the redesign of ceramic modules to laminate based packaging are presented. Design rules for via diameter and pad diameter are discussed. Thermal cycling and thermal shock evaluations are performed on a test vehicle that represents wiring densities and techniques that are employed in production.

To increase the bandwidth of the CDM, an FPC RF interface was introduced to the CDM package, which significantly improved the roll-off frequency by about 40 GHz compared with a conventional package with a surface-mount-type RF interface. The FPC package has a 3-dB bandwidth of about 75 GHz and roll-off frequency above 110 GHz. These are the best characteristics among the CDM packages reported so far. By integrating a modulator with an electro-optic (EO) 3-dB bandwidth of >67 GHz and a driver IC with an electrical 3-dB bandwidth of >75 GHz in this package, the CDM had an EO 3-dB bandwidth of >72 GHz.

In these devices, the conducting metal lines connecting various components are typically fabricated using a low-cost metal or metal oxide particles-based ink technology in contrast to conventional/expensive photolithography with subtractive or additive metal deposition technology. In this paper, fabrication of Cu metal lines over glass was evaluated by application of Cu(I) oxide Cu2O nano-particle-based ink precursor material consisting of an organic polymer reducing agent dispersed in a simple organic solvent and subsequently reducing the oxide particles through a laser beam-based sintering/reduction process. The ink precursor composition was optimized for the lowest specific resistivity values of the fabricated Cu lines by varying the Cu2O particle weight %, ratio of nano-particle to the organic polymer reducing agent and the molecular wt. of the polymer. The reliability of these Cu lines was tested by baking them up to 400 °C and it was determined that the use of an organic polymer reducing agent can protect the Cu from oxidation around 370 °C without affecting the specific resistivity value. Detailed analyses of the metal lines fabricated with this technology are discussed using X-ray diffraction study for metal/metal oxides contents and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy for an organic polymer degradation mechanism. In addition, application of Cu2O nano-particle-based precursor technology to repair open circuit lines has been demonstrated.","1558-2574","","10.1109/TDMR.2016.2612940","Basic Science Research Program of the Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) through the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning(grant numbers:2012-010307); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7574387","Copper(I) oxide;laser assisted reduction;printed electronics;process window control;electrode repair","Ink;Metals;Electrodes;Conductivity;Polymers;Laser beams;Reliability","copper alloys;copper compounds;flexible electronics;Fourier transform infrared spectra;interconnections;laser sintering;nanoparticles;polymers;reliability;X-ray diffraction","open circuit lines;organic polymer degradation mechanism;Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy;X-ray diffraction;organic polymer reducing agent;laser beam-based sintering-reduction process;organic solvent;nanoparticle-based ink precursor material;subtractive metal deposition technology;additive metal deposition technology;photolithography;metal oxide particles-based ink technology;conducting metal lines;consumer electronics;flexible plastic substrates;printed electronic devices;material reliability;material composition optimization;copper(I) oxide particle-based precursor ink technology;copper interconnects;Cu","","3","","20","IEEE","22 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The bonding portion structure is composed of Au bumps with two-stepped construction and conductive adhesives. The conductive adhesive is very flexible in bond, thus relaxing thermal and mechanical stresses. The ALIVH substrate is a high density and high performance multilayered printed wiring board with any layer inner via hole structure, CO/sub 2/ laser via hole processing technology and interconnection technology which employs conductive paste. We had good results for several reliability tests in the advanced MCM-L test vehicles. In particular, in the thermal shock test, the increase in connection resistance in the advanced MCM-Ls was smaller than that of MCM-Ls which used ordinary organic substrates instead of the ALIVH substrate. We manufactured a CCD camera module using these MCM-Ls. LSI chips were mounted on the six-layered ALIVH substrate. The MCM-Ls obtained was downsized (60% down) and lighter in weight (30% reduction) when compared with the conventional module, and the electrical characteristics of the newly manufactured CCD camera module were equal to those of the conventional module.","","0-7803-5090-1","10.1109/IEMTIM.1998.704631","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=704631","","Consumer electronics;Bonding;Testing;Large scale integration;Conductive adhesives;Thermal resistance;Manufacturing;Charge coupled devices;Charge-coupled image sensors;Multichip modules","multichip modules;integrated circuit packaging;laminates;flip-chip devices;conducting polymers;adhesives;thermal stresses;internal stresses;stress relaxation;thermal shock;integrated circuit reliability;CCD image sensors;consumer electronics;cameras;integrated circuit interconnections;laser materials processing;laser beam machining","MCM-Ls;consumer electronics;multichip module;stud-bump bonding flip-chip technique;any layer inner via hole structure substrate;ALIVH substrate;SBB flip-chip technique;bare LSI chip mounting;bonding portion structure;Au bumps;conductive adhesives;flexible conductive adhesive bond;mechanical stress relaxation;thermal stress relaxation;multilayered printed wiring board;any layer inner via hole structure;CO/sub 2/ laser via hole processing technology;interconnection technology;conductive paste;reliability tests;MCM-L test vehicles;thermal shock test;connection resistance;organic substrates;CCD camera module;MCM-L downsizing;MCM-L weight reduction;electrical characteristics;Au;CO/sub 2/","","1","2","9","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In comparison to conventional manufacturing process chain, additive manufacturing enables in principle embedding of conductive circuits and electronic components during the part building process. However, technologies like Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) or stereolithography (SLA) imply disadvantages concerning high process temperatures or time consuming cleaning steps. In contrast, Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) seems to be well suited for production of mechatronic integrated devices due to the use of thermoplastic materials for electronic productions (e.g. ABS, PC/ABS), a low thermal load of electronic parts and a simple process management. In this paper, additive manufacturing of mechatronic devices by means of FDM in combination with direct printing of silver ink for generating conductive circuits is investigated. The silver ink is deposited in the matrix or applied on the surface of the part by a dispensing system during the building process. The in situ sintering process of the ink is carried out by a subsequently infrared laser (IR) irradiation. In order to generate components with a high mechanical stability the adhesion of the extruded material strings is optimized considering processing temperature and flow properties of the extruded thermoplastics (ABS, PC/ABS). Furthermore, depending on the flow behavior important FDM process parameters (e.g. volume flow, hatch distance) are adjusted to minimize cavities and generate media-tight components. The conductive circuits are characterized with respect to their electrical conductivity and mechanical stability.","","978-1-5090-5428-2","10.1109/ICMID.2016.7738927","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7738927","Additive manufacturing;electrical conductive circuits;embedding;silver particle ink;sintering by laser radiation","Frequency division multiplexing;Ink;Silver;Laser sintering;Thermal stability;Buildings;Temperature","electrical conductivity;electron device manufacture;mechanical stability;rapid prototyping (industrial);three-dimensional printing","mechatronic integrated device production;additive manufacturing;conductive circuit;electronic component;electronic production;fused deposition modelling;FDM;silver ink direct printing;infrared laser irradiation;IR irradiation;flow behavior;electrical conductivity;mechanical stability","","3","","15","IEEE","24 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to meet realistic automotive specifications with OPAs, >500 antenna elements should work reliably under tight power and cost budgets. Existing multi-chip solutions necessitate expensive packaging and assembly to achieve high interconnect density. Even with 2-D monolithic integration, high-voltage drivers to deliver sufficient power to resistive phase shifters typically result in significant overhead in die area and limited power efficiency. In this article, we introduce a single-chip OPA realized through wafer-scale 3-D integration of silicon photonics and CMOS. Flexible and ultra-dense connections with through-oxide vias (TOVs) in our platform resolve the I/O density issue. Moreover, low-voltage L-shaped phase shifters and compact, efficient switch-mode drivers, connected vertically using TOVs, remove wiring/placement overhead and achieve a large active array aperture within a compact die. Our OPA prototype achieves wide-range 2-D steering over 18.5°×16° by leveraging wavelength tuning and phase control, and array scaling up to 125 elements with a large aperture size of 0.5 mm×0.5 mm and 0.15°×0.25° beamwidth while consuming 20 mW/element average power. Since our system supports per-element independent phase control, increased sensitivity to process variations in L-shaped shifters is fully compensated by a simple calibration process.","1558-173X","","10.1109/JSSC.2019.2934601","Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency(grant numbers:HR0011-12-2-0007); Army Research Office(grant numbers:W911NF-12-1-0210); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8828069","3-D integration;LiDAR;optical phased array (OPA);silicon photonics;solid-state optical beam-steering","Laser radar;Photonics;Optical sensors;Optical beams;Phased arrays;Optical variables control;Silicon","beam steering;calibration;CMOS integrated circuits;driver circuits;elemental semiconductors;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated optics;integrated optoelectronics;phase control;phase shifters;silicon;three-dimensional integrated circuits;wafer-scale integration","single-chip optical phased array;silicon photonics platforms;OPAs;solid-state optical beam-steering;realistic automotive specifications;cost budgets;multichip solutions;high interconnect density;2-D monolithic integration;high-voltage drivers;resistive phase shifters;limited power efficiency;single-chip OPA;wafer-scale 3-D;low-voltage L-shaped phase shifters;compact switch-mode drivers;efficient switch-mode drivers;active array aperture;wavelength tuning;per-element independent phase control;through-oxide vias;wavelength 0.5 mm;power 20.0 mW;wavelength 0.5 mm","","46","","44","IEEE","10 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to its technical and 3D design freedom, new markets and innovative products arise that were initially unthinkable. However, the focus of research is currently on mastering and improving the printing process. The subsequent process step of drying and densifying the printed structures to achieve high conductivities in the shortest possible time is up to now hardly considered. This paper treats the inquiry of fitted and optimized parameters of alternative promising photonic sintering methods for printed electronics compared to the much more time-intensive state of the art sintering process in a furnace. These photonic sintering methods comprise the near infrared, ultraviolet light as well as laser irradiation of the printed structures. Photonic sintering promises faster and more efficient curing and sintering due to the direct and selective application of energy to the printing structures without damaging the temperature-sensitive substrates. As substrate materials ABS and PC-ABS, as well as a glass material were used. Both polymer materials are standard and technical thermoplastics which are available at the market in huge quantities at low price. For the manufacture of printed circuits, a dispense printer was used, in order to process a low-cost silver-based micro particle paste. The evaluation of the sintering result was carried out based on the electrical conductivity of the printed conductor path and the adhesion strength on the substrate. In addition, the sintering time required for the curing of the structures as well as impacts on the substrate or the printed tracks due to photonic treatment were taken into account. To perform the experiments, two different print layouts were set up in order to be able to assess the electrical properties on the first layout and the adhesion on the second layout. To obtain a detailed statement on the exploration on the photonic sintering methods, a fully factorial design plan was conducted. For the near-infrared irradiation, the important parameters were the irradiation duration and the irradiation power. While sintered by ultraviolet light, the parameters were irradiation time, as well as the distance between the sample surface and the UV emitter. In the treatment by means of laser radiation, laser power and the motion speed were identified as the relevant parameters. In order to be able to draw a comparison to the mainly used sintering method, samples were also sintered in a furnace. The results show a significant reduction of the sintering time to a few seconds with comparable and even significantly better electrical and mechanical properties.","","978-1-944543-14-3","10.23919/PanPacific48324.2020.9059353","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9059353","Printed Electronics;Polymer;Photonic Sintering;Alternative Sintering;Conductivity","Conductivity;Radiation effects;Periodic structures;Substrates;Glass;Laser sintering;Photonics","adhesion;curing;flexible electronics;ink jet printing;polymers;printed circuits;printing;silver;sintering","3D design freedom;printing process;printed structures;printed electronics;sintering process;ultraviolet light;laser irradiation;printing structures;printed circuits;low-cost silver-based microparticle paste;sintering result;printed conductor path;sintering time;printed tracks;photonic treatment;near-infrared irradiation;irradiation time;photonic sintering methods;print layouts","","2","","10","","9 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper describes the manufacturing process chain of direct metallization by plasma based copper coating and shows the potentials of this technology. Circuits can be applied to almost any base substrate such as polymers, ceramics or even metal since an insulating dielectric lacquer layer separates the substrate from the metallization. In contrast to previous plasma based copper depositing processes the digital direct metallization enables clearly defined fine structures without using any inflexible and high-maintenance masks [1]. An enormous advantage of this procedure is the complete elimination of wet chemical process steps, which are known from the laser direct structuring method (LDS) [2].

Up until now, most prostheses were powered using an inductive link coupled with cables penetrating through the eyeball. Although they efficiently power the implant, they limit long-term reliability and cause postoperative complications. A fully wireless near-infrared power and data link entering the eye through the pupil alleviates these issues but limits the available power and causes energy supply interruptions during blinking. This article presents a retinal implant ASIC architecture optimized for optical operation despite these constraints. It contains 288 individually controlled electrode drivers, each connected to electrode pads with a pitch of 150 μm. A digital controller with a stateless communication scheme allows flexible stimulation sequences and is capable of restoring stimulation within 3 ms after an eye blink.

Printing, being an additive process, would greatly reduce the amount of energy, labor and material used by the current manufacturing processes to deposit and pattern ITO. In this work, gravure printability of ITO nanoparticles on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was studied. A wide range of sheet resistivites and film thicknesses was obtained by varying the specifications of the gravure cells. From the regression analysis of the results, a good estimation of sheet resistivity of the printed films at different gravure cell volumes and aspect ratios (AR) was achieved. The films also showed transparency above 95% in the visible light region. In addition, printed ITO films were assessed for mechanical flexibility and the results compared to commercially available sputtered ITO films on PET. The electrical performance of printed ITO layers was not deteriorated with bending in contrast to the sputtered films. Therefore, printed ITO films can be of great benefit for applications in flexible electronics such as organic photovoltaics (OPV), liquid crystal displays (LCD), organic light-emitting diodes (OLED), touch screens, biosensors and utilization in the field of energy efficiency, especially in buildings.","1558-9323","","10.1109/JDT.2012.2191765","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6189370","Gravure printing;flexible electronics;ITO nanoparticles;transparent electrodes","Indium tin oxide;Printing;Ink;Conductivity;Nanoparticles;Electrodes;Positron emission tomography","electrodes;flexible electronics;indium compounds;polymers;printed circuit manufacture;regression analysis","gravure printing;transparent electrodes;flexible electronics;polyethylene terephthalate;regression analysis;sheet resistivity;printed films;gravure cell volumes;visible light;ITO","","27","","25","IEEE","24 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The adhesion of the gasket-underfill with the overglazed ceramics (used as test vehicle for package) is evaluated. The application of pre-structured underfill applied prior to electrical bonding ensures voids & bubble-free underfilling and allows for contamination-free interfaces of the mating surfaces. It also eliminates the risk of air or entrapment during underfilling providing which poses a risk for water condensation and short circuiting between contacts.

A high quality flexible display product demanded the whole package structure to be flexible, which caught the attention of researchers to develop the UTC (ultra-thin chip) on flex technology. This paper focused on the interconnection method between ultra-thin chip and flexible substrate. A novel SoP (Solder-on-Pad) process was employed on the Cu pad of flexible substrate, where the patterned PI (Polyimide) film acted as a natural stencil for solder paste printing. Firstly, Cu trace was etched from the 2L-FCCL (Two-layer Flexible Copper Clad Laminate). Next, the PI film was laser drilled to form the pad opening and served as the stencil for solder printing. Solder caps took shape after reflow, which were also protected by the surrounding PI film. Finally, the Daisy-chain UTC (50μm) with gold stud on Al pad was aligned and attached to the flexible substrate with solder cap on Cu pad to accomplish electrical interconnection through Au stud-solder bump joint. Resistance of bonding joint was measured before and after TCT (thermal cycling test), results showed good electrical connection and no mechanical defect were observed.","","978-1-4673-7999-1","10.1109/ICEPT.2015.7236669","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7236669","Solder-on-pad;Chip on Flex;Ultra-thin chip","Substrates;Printing;Packaging;Liquids;Gold;Intermetallic;Reliability","copper;flexible electronics;gold;integrated circuit packaging;laser beam machining;polymer films","ultrathin chip;solder-on-pad technology;chip-on-flex packaging;liquid crystal display;flexible display product;flexible substrate;polyimide film;natural stencil;solder paste printing;laser drilling;bonding joint resistance;thermal cycling test;electrical connection;Cu;Au","","3","","17","","3 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Welding requires the melting of the Al layers in order to form a reliable electrical and mechanical contact. Here, we investigate the process driving the melt front of the aluminum, which is attached to a transparent substrate, toward the interface between the two Al layers. In experiments, we observe two different mechanisms depending on the thickness of the irradiated layer. In the case of Al layers thinner than 5 μm, a melt-through of the Al-layer is observed, whereas for thicker layers, thermal expansion causes a breakage of the surface and ejection of molten Al, which enables the contact formation. Using simulations that are based on the finite-element method, we instigate both mechanisms. The simulation results match the experimental observations within the measurement uncertainty. In case of thin layers, the simulation shows that the process is limited by thermal diffusion. For thicker Al layers, the onset of melting on the irradiated side initiates the breakage of the surface and the ejection of the aluminum.","2156-3403","","10.1109/JPHOTOV.2015.2478027","State of Lower Saxony, Germany; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7296574","Al metallization;cell interconnection;finite-element method (FEM) simulations;laser processing;module integration;Al metallization;cell interconnection;finite-element method (FEM) simulations;laser processing;module integration","Glass;Finite element analysis;Aluminum;Welding;Surface morphology;Surface treatment;Metallization","aluminium;electrical contacts;elemental semiconductors;finite element analysis;integrated circuit interconnections;laser beam welding;mechanical contact;melting;semiconductor device metallisation;semiconductor device models;silicon;solar cells;thermal diffusivity;thermal expansion","laser welding;glass substrates;module interconnection;silicon solar cells;melting;electrical contact;mechanical contact;transparent substrate;thermal expansion;finite-element method;measurement uncertainty;thermal diffusion;Al-Si;SiO2","","3","","17","IEEE","12 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then a low latency pipeline-based static task scheduling stage is proposed to arrange task sequence in IP cores. Finally a best hardware resource demand for the application could be predicted for reference. OFCA can fully exploit the parallel characteristics within task graphs to minimize inter-cluster communication and limit copying tasks when clustering to reduce extra execution energy. It also controls the use of task-duplication-technique (TDT) by setting different parameters for flexible goals to make a compromise between energy and latency. Experiments show that objectives can be adjusted via different parameter ratios performing OFCA and 57% energy savings on average can be achieved compared to CM Algorithm when employed to streaming applications of 18, 36, and 40 tasks.","","978-1-4244-5513-3","10.1109/RCSLPLT.2010.5615317","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5615317","Network-on-Chip;Mapping;Task Scheduling;Clustering","Clustering algorithms;IP networks;Scheduling;Energy consumption;Computer architecture;Processor scheduling;Color","integrated circuit design;network-on-chip;scheduling","objective-flexible clustering algorithm;task scheduling;network-on-chip;cluster-based NoC;low energy task mapping;inter-cluster communication;task-duplication-technique","","5","","13","","1 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The advent of 2-Dimensional (2D) materials [3] show promise in this regard as they can be easily solution processed by using a mass scalable and low cost method, called Liquid-Phase Exfoliation [4]. 2D materials shows great promise for use in flexible electronics because their atomic thickness allows for maximum electrostatic control, optical transparency, sensitivity and mechanical flexibility [5].

These techniques, such as high density interconnects (HDI) for printed circuit boards (PCBs) make the devices less expensive and allow for more functionality to be packed into ever decreasing dimensions. The advantages of HDI PCBs are numerous and include finer copper traces, thinner and more flexible base materials and laser drilled via holes. HDI PCBs have played a crucial role in creating miniature smartphones and other embedded subsystems and the demands of 5G technology are pushing the limits of HDI technology even further. Researchers in the electronics manufacturing space are highly motivated to formulate solutions for the HDI market, especially acid copper via fill solutions to meet the market demands.Two innovative DC acid copper micro-via fill plating electrolytes are discussed in this paper. One is for an advanced tenting process and the other is for modified semi additive process (mSAP), with VCP (Vertical Continues Plating) applications. These two acid copper via fill processes can provide fine line resolution from the range of 35 μm to 20 μm, which enables makers of 5G smartphones and other demanding gadgets to achieve unprecedented densities while offering superior geometries with exacting impedance control for their high frequency operation. The electrolyte for advanced tenting process has distinctly rapid filling performance, which allows this electrolyte to plate very thin copper on the surface while filling the vias. For example, 125×75 μm vias are seamlessly filled with only 10 μm of Cu on the surface. The advantage with such thin plated copper is to eliminate copper reduction process, thus eliminating the issue of V-pitting which originates in the half-etch step. Advanced advanced tenting process is still a subtractive process, which allows the fabricators to use current equipment and a similar process to manufacture advanced HDI PCBs. The electrolyte for mSAP can fill blind micro-vias and plate through holes simultaneously. This feature resolves the copper plating challenge having to fill micro-vias or to plate through holes using separate processes. The “additive” nature of mSAP is such that copper plated on a much thinner base copper layer, with the thin base copper layer then etched away in what is called the flash etch step. This process offers copper traces that can be prepared with much greater precision, in straight vertical lines, yielding a rectangular-shaped lines that better maximize circuit density and enable accurate impedance control with lower signal loss. This paper discusses the capabilities from these two plating processes.","2150-5942","978-1-7281-6070-2","10.1109/IMPACT47228.2019.9024954","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9024954","","Copper;Plating;Electrolytes;Surface treatment;Additives;Filling;5G mobile communication","copper;electroplating;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit packaging;printed circuit design;printed circuit manufacture;vias","advanced tenting process;modified semiadditive process;mSAP;VCP applications;high frequency operation;plated copper;copper reduction process;subtractive process;blind microvias;copper plating;separate processes;copper traces;circuit density;copper electroplating processes;advanced HDI applications;5G communications technology;manufacturing techniques;high density interconnects;printed circuit boards;miniature smartphones;HDI technology;electronics manufacturing space;HDI market;flexible base materials;base copper layer;advanced HDI PCB;rapid filling performance;vertical continues plating;microvia fill plating electrolytes;innovative DC acid copper;5G technology;electronics manufacturing;5G smartphones;V-pitting;mSAP electrolyte;rectangular-shaped lines;impedance control;size 20.0 mum to 35.0 mum;Cu","","2","","5","","5 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such a rapid growth rate cannot be accommodated by simple scaling of existing equipment practices: not only the cost but also the size and power consumption would be prohibitive. Technical innovation has provided the solution: optical fibre links in the core network now routinely run at 10 Gbit/s per wavelength, providing a total capacity in the region of 1 Tbit/s on a single fibre through the deployment of wavelength division multiplexing (WDM), whilst data rates of 40 Gbit/s and 100 Gbit/s per wavelength are increasingly employed. With the adoption of advanced modulation formats and coherent systems, 100 Gbit/s can now be transmitted over fibre infrastructure that was designed for 10 Gbit/s [2], while tunable lasers and reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexers (ROADMs) allow network operators to reroute traffic in a highly flexible and dynamic manner, allowing optimum use of their assets. Optical terminal equipment in modern systems is accordingly much more complex than was possible hitherto, whilst size, power and cost have been continuously reduced. An important enabling factor in achieving these objectives is the availability of monolithic photonic integrated circuit (PIC) technology.","","978-1-4799-0594-2","10.1109/CLEOE-IQEC.2013.6801456","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6801456","","Optical transmitters;Modulation;Optical fibers;Photonics;Integrated optics;Indium phosphide;Optical fiber communication","III-V semiconductors;integrated optics;integrated optoelectronics;lasers;multiplexing equipment;optical communication equipment;optical links;wavelength division multiplexing","integrated photonic devices;III-V semiconductors;optical communication;internet;transmission capacity;compound annual growth rate;power consumption;optical fibre links;single fibre;wavelength division multiplexing;WDM;tunable lasers;reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexers;optical terminal equipment;modern systems;monolithic photonic integrated circuit technology","","","","7","","21 Apr 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

High-performance colored polymer films, such as polyimide, are most commonly employed as flex substrates. However, taking the feasibility for a wide range of optical applications and a low-cost procurement into account, transparent polymer foils, such as polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), exhibit a greater prospect. A major challenge in using these polymer foils as flexible carriers lies in the thermal loading control depending on their low glass transition temperatures (Tg). Thus, we propose flip chip-based optodic bonding for chip-on-flex packaging by employing these cost-effective transparent polymer foils. In this bonding technology, conventional thermal loading is minimized since UV curable adhesives are used as bonding materials and an optode is correspondingly adopted. Additionally, the fine-pitch circuits on the flex substrates are designed according to the chips and fabricated by screen printing technology using silver nanoparticles. Considering the effects on the bonding performance, which result from the rheological behavior of the adhesives during dispensing and applying, contact angles between the adhesives and polymer foils are measured for determining the appropriate volume. In order to protect the silver interconnects as well as the applied adhesives from oxidation and thus attaining a long-term stability in respect to the electrical conductivity, a functionalized coating against ambient moisture is implemented onto the flex circuit. Through the performance tests of the final packages for a test chip and a bare optoelectronic component, this novel technology is verified as a promising solution for fine-pitch chip-on-flex packaging.","","978-0-9888-8739-8","10.1109/PanPacific.2016.7428418","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7428418","chip-on-flex packaging;fine-pitch;transparent polymer foils;flip chip bonding;functionalized coating;UV-curing adhesives;contact angles;screen-printing","Bonding;Polymers;Packaging;Layout;Substrates;Integrated circuit interconnections;Contacts","adhesive bonding;curing;flexible electronics;flip-chip devices;integrated circuit packaging;integrated optoelectronics","bare optoelectronic component;adhesive rheological behavior;silver nanoparticle;screen printing technology;UV curable adhesives;flip chip based optodic bonding;thermal loading control;PMMA;polymethyl methacrylate;transparent polymer foils;low temperature optodic bonding;optoelectronic devices;fine pitch chip-on-flex packaging","","2","","18","","10 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this structure, there are no any supporting and permanent substrates needed. A 3um copper foil with 18um carrier layer was used as temporal substrate. The carrier layer will be removed after chip embedded process. After patterning and etching processes, the temporal copper foil became the bottom circuit that will connect with the other Ultra-Thin Film Package(UTFP). Ultra thin chips with around 15∼20µm thickness were assembled directly on the structured Cu foils in a flip-chip fashion. The structured Cu foils were patterned by laser to enhance the wettability with solder. The gap between chip and copper foil was only about 15µm after the die bonding process. In order to fabricate the ultra thin chip, plasma dry etching was applied to release the stress induced during the grinding process and also made the chips' strength higher. The strength of ultra thin chip with and without plasma treatment was also compared. Subsequently, the chips were embedded into highly elastic polyurethane materials, with a copper foil always laminated on the top. The resultant UTFP has a thickness of less than 80 µm. The process details on ultra-thin wafer manufacturing, ultra-thin chip bonding, fine gap with underfill dispensing, thin chip lamination, laser drilling, laser patterning and stacking are also disclosed in this paper. The stacking process of UTFP is also a key technology in this paper. Because the stacking temperature is controlled below 150°C, Anisotropic Conductive Film(ACF) material was used as the connecting medium. So far, the single UTFP has passed static bending test for 200 hours and dynamic bending test for 500 cycles under 5mm bending curvature radius. In the future, the reliability tests which include TCT and TAST tests will be also executed, but not shown in this paper. The numerical simulation method will also be revealed to figure out the most critical point during UTFP fabrication process and the stacking process.","2377-5726","978-1-4244-4475-5","10.1109/ECTC.2009.5074201","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5074201","","Manufacturing;Stacking;Packaging;Copper;Testing;Substrates;Plasma applications;Plasma materials processing;Optical materials;Etching","copper;electronics packaging;flexible electronics;flip-chip devices;integrated circuit reliability;laser beam machining;microassembling;numerical analysis;solders;thin films;wetting","ultra thin film packages;flexible package;embedded active chips;chip embedded process;copper foil;flip chip fashion;solder wettability;die bonding;plasma dry etching;plasma treatment;elastic polyurethane materials;ultra thin wafer manufacturing;ultra thin chip bonding;thin chip lamination;laser drilling;laser patterning;anisotropic conductive film;reliability tests;numerical simulation;UTFP fabrication process","","2","","7","","12 Jun 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the future, networks will continue to be shared between static voice circuits and increasing amounts of dynamic traffic that is often referred to as packet, IP, or data traffic. This mixture of traffic puts new requirements on the design of core public networks and stresses their ability to scale to meet capacity demand at backbone distances. When bandwidth hungry applications such as cable modem, Storage Area Networks (SANs), and peer-to-peer networking become commonplace in access networks, the wide-area network or core network will need to respond by operating much more like a LAN in terms of being flexible and data ready.

To this end, femtosecond lasers have been attractive to pattern refractive index structures inside transparent materials, creating 3D optical circuits and diffractive optics with new types of form-birefringence. However, such flexible writing is burdened with limited resolution and low phase contrast from positive and negative index zones.

Then, the role of traffic grooming in flexible-grid and elastic-rate optical networks is re-examined. The impact of some new optical-layer technologies on traffic-grooming paradigm is discussed. Particularly, sliceable optical layer based on sliceable transponders and BV-ROADM is identified as a novel technology that could impact the future grooming paradigm by offloading considerable amount of traffic and part of electronic grooming function to the optical layer. We propose two novel network architectures based on sliceable optical layer and numerically compare them with the traditional packet-over-optical network architecture. It is found that packet-over-sliceable network architecture consumes the fewest transponders and at the same time achieves either the “lowest-possible” latency or least spectrum usage. Finally, traffic grooming, which involves multi-layer resource orchestration, should be controlled by software with a centralized view of the network to accommodate the dynamic requirements of applications.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2014.2317576","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6798760","Elastic optical network;flexible grid;sliceable transponder;software-defined elasticity;spectrum usage;traffic grooming","Optical packet switching;Optical transmitters;Optical receivers;Transponders;Optical switches;Optical fibers","packet switching;SONET;synchronous digital hierarchy;telecommunication traffic;transponders;wavelength division multiplexing","multilayer flexible-grid optical networks;software-defined elasticity;elastic-rate transponders;spectrum efficiency;traffic grooming;SONET-SDH;WDM networks;packet switching;electronic circuit switching;elastic-rate optical networks;flexible-grid optical networks;sliceable optical layer;sliceable transponders;BV-ROADM;packet-over-optical network architecture;packet-over-sliceable network architecture;multilayer resource orchestration","","33","","20","IEEE","15 Apr 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This extreme detection environment raises unique challenges, from obvious to surprising, and leads to treating detectors as consumables. We discuss in detail the detector damage mechanisms observed in 7 years of operation at LCLS, together with the corresponding damage mitigation strategies and their effectiveness. Main types of damage mechanisms already identified include: (1) x-ray radiation damage (from “catastrophic” to “classical”), (2) direct and indirect damage caused by optical lasers, (3) sample induced damage, (4) vacuum related damage, (5) high-pressure environment. In total, 19 damage mechanisms have been identified. We also present general strategies for reducing damage risk or minimizing the impact of detector damage on the science program. These include availability of replacement parts and skilled operators and also careful planning, incident investigation resulting in updated designs, procedures and operator training.","1558-1578","","10.1109/TNS.2016.2567448","Basic Energy Sciences(grant numbers:DE-AC02-76-SF00515); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7469372","X-ray detectors;damage;risk reduction;radiation damage;EMP;ESD;free-electron lasers;LCLS;CSPAD;pnCCD;CSPAD;damage;EMP;ESD;free-electron lasers;LCLS;PNCCD;radiation damage;risk reduction;X-ray detectors","Detectors;Cameras;Laser beams;X-ray diffraction;Diffraction;Application specific integrated circuits","","","","3","","28","USGov","12 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Measurements on prototypes of the designed stretchable high-frequency interconnects revealed a maximal magnitude of -14 dB for the reflection coefficient and a minimal magnitude of -4 dB for the transmission coefficient in the frequency band up to 3 GHz.

The requirement for greater interconnection capabilities, spawned in part by the advances in integrated circuit technologies and the need for enhanced digital services, dictate that technology advancement must occur in traditional electronic packaging and/or interconnection techniques. The resolution of these technological needs is paramount for the successful competitive introduction of these systems. Presently, a ""bottle-neck"" occurs at the board-to-board level of the interconnection hierarchy. Therefore, an opportunity exists for the development of new optical interconnection techniques which can be incorporated into system designs beginning at this interconnection level and beyond. The strategic insertion of optical interconnection technology into these electronic processing systems not only meets projected performance requirements, but potentially offers them at a competitive cost. This paper describes some of the new optical strategies switching equipment designers are incorporating into today's products.

The lightweight, robust and compact sensors are extensively used in manifold low-power applications. Recently, scribed and flexible laser-induced graphene sensors have shown potent capabilities for a variety of measurements, including flow, deflection, and force. Achieving a high sensitivity to various stimuli remains a challenge due to limited change in relative resistance. In this paper, we report a multifunctional LIG sensor with widely tunable properties and significantly enhanced electromechanical performance. A method of repeated laser writing is used to increase the porosity, the uniform carbonization degree and, most importantly, the sensitivity of the LIG sensors. A gauge factor of 91.2 is achieved after three-times laser writing at low power, which is an increase of 750% to one-time laser writing and 720% higher than the ones previously reported for LIG strain sensors. The increase is attributed to a more porous surface morphology that provides more overlapping area and displacement of the graphene layers. A homogeneous bidirectional response was obtained by scribing the electrodes on both faces of the substrate. Parylene C-coating is used to protect the LIG sensors from environmental effects. Coated sensors were packaged to a PCB assembly for easy integration into various applications. An example is a LIG bending sensor customized for velocity profile monitoring of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in the outdoor environment.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2021.3088348","Coupled Animal and Artificial Sensing for Sustainable Ecosystems (CAASE) Project through the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) under the KAUST Sensor Initiative; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9450806","Flexible;graphene;sensors;strain;unmanned aerial vehicles;velocity","Sensors;Writing;Lasers;Graphene;Bending;Fabrication;Electromechanical sensors","antireflection coatings;assembling;electrodes;graphene devices;optical fabrication;optical films;optical sensors;printed circuits","multilasing fabrication;resistive strain sensor;low-power applications;multifunctional LIG sensor;repeated laser writing;uniform carbonization degree;LIG strain sensors;coated sensors;LIG bending sensor;flexible laser-induced graphene sensor layers;Parylene C-coating;strain gauge;homogeneous bidirectional response;unmanned aerial vehicles;porous surface morphology;C","","","","51","IEEE","10 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Direct write (DW) technologies used to print three-dimensional (3D) electronic and sensor devices have experienced spectacular growth due to their capability to offer rapid prototyping of high-performance devices for a broad range of applications. This growth is driven by many factors to include significantly reduced design-to-product lead time and fabrication of complex geometries on conformal and flexible substrates. Originally developed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Mesoscopic Integrated Conformal Electronics (MICE) Program for the fabrication of mesoscale electronics, DW technologies have been explored for a range of applications including active and passive components, sensors, 3D structures, as well as applications in biology. This paper focuses on one emerging DW approach, Aerosol Jet Printing (AJP), as a non-contact method to print fine features using different types of materials over various surfaces. Aerosol Jet systems are able to print a wide variety of electronically, optically, and biologically functional materials on geometrically complex substrates that can be conformal, flexible, and stretchable. The Aerosol Jet process utilizes printable inks based on solutions or nanoparticle suspensions and can include metals, alloys, ceramics, polymers, adhesives, and/or biomaterials. A wide variety of substrates, to include silicon, polyimide, glass, FR-4 and aluminum oxide can be used to print these materials provided the ink is compatible with the substrate. Like other DW technologies, the AJP process offers the distinct benefit of fabrication without conventional masks, with a reduction in material consumption due to selective deposition of inks at digitally defined locations on the substrate. Use of this additive process eliminates the waste of hazardous materials used in the etching processes employed by subtractive methods. AJP systems use an atomizer to create a dense aerosol of micro-droplets that are focused into an aerosol stream, resulting in deposits that can be one tenth the size of the nozzle opening at a standoff height of up to 5 millimeters. These capabilities enable the fabrication of highly integrated devices expanding from the originally targeted mesoscale application to micro- and nano-scale applications. Design and innovative fabrication of more connected and “smart” products can be realized using AJP to meet the miniaturized, flexible, and conformal form factors desired in today's Internet of Things (IoT) global marketplace. AJP technology has opened up new avenues for bio-integrated electronics to include electronic textiles, wearable electrochemical systems, electronic epidermal tattoos, and permanent and dissolvable implantable devices. While it has been demonstrated that AJP is an enabling technology in the growing field of wearable devices, there are major challenges in widespread adoption of this innovative approach. This paper provides an overview of AJP technology and summarizes the historical underpinning of its development, underlying principles of its technique, and challenges presented in widening its adoption with industry.","","978-1-944543-14-3","10.23919/PanPacific48324.2020.9059444","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9059444","Aerosol Jet Printing;Direct Write;Printed Electronics;Internet of Things;mesoscale electronics;flexible hybrid electronics;bio-integrated electronics;electronic textiles;wearable electrochemical systems","Substrates;Consumer electronics;Aerosols;Printing;Ink;Writing;Fabrication","adhesives;aerosols;biomedical electronics;electronics industry;etching;flexible electronics;ink;ink jet printing;laser materials processing;microfabrication;nanoparticles;nozzles;polymers;printed circuit manufacture;printing;rapid prototyping (industrial);silicon;suspensions;three-dimensional printing","aerosol jet printing;wearable devices;printed electronics;high-performance devices;design-to-product lead time;conformal substrates;flexible substrates;Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Mesoscopic Integrated Conformal Electronics Program;mesoscale electronics;DW technologies;noncontact method;print fine features;biologically functional materials;geometrically complex substrates;aerosol jet process;material consumption;additive process;hazardous materials;AJP systems;dense aerosol;aerosol stream;mesoscale application;nanoscale applications;innovative fabrication;smart products;miniaturized form factors;conformal form factors;AJP technology;bio-integrated electronics;electronic textiles;wearable electrochemical systems;electronic epidermal tattoos;permanent devices;dissolvable implantable devices;aerosol jet systems;MICE","","5","","30","","9 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The fabrication approach utilizes the well-established processes from wafer level packaging and redistribution technology. Multi-layer routing structures are built by sequential processing of polyimide and semi-additive metal on a carrier wafer with a dedicated release layer. Depending on the number of copper routing layers with typical thickness of 3-5 μm and the required polymer inter dielectric thickness the final multi-layer stacks can have total thicknesses between 20-60 μm. A laser assisted process allows an easy detach of the thin film flex circuits from the carrier wafer. The technology allows high density routing with lines and spaces of 7/7 μm over up to four layers, custom specific front and back side contacts of Au, Cu, NiAu or solder (only front side) to enable different assembly technologies, embedding option for ultra-thin ICs, option for partial rigidness by utilizing the carrier as permanent stiffener as well as option for arbitrary shaped outlines.Three application examples for the high-density flex technology are shown. The first one is a thin film flex with embedded ICs, which is a technology demonstrator for usage as system core of cardiac monitoring patches. The second example includes rigid flex demonstrators with embedded ICs for implementation of 24/60 GHz radar sensor devices. And as a third application case thin film flex is used as polymeric substrate with front and back side contacts. Those thin substrates can be used as interposers or can be stacked on top of each other to enable a multiplication of routing layers. All details regarding the different technology options as well as application examples will be discussed in this paper.","2377-5726","978-1-6654-7943-1","10.1109/ECTC51906.2022.00165","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9816574","thin film flex;thin chip embedding;high density fine pitch routing;polymer interposer","Integrated circuits;Gold;Flexible printed circuits;Wires;Radar;Packaging;Routing","copper;gold alloys;laser materials processing;network routing;nickel alloys;wafer level packaging","wafer level packaging;redistribution technology;multilayer routing structures;sequential processing;carrier wafer;dedicated release layer;copper routing layers;final multilayer stacks;laser assisted process;film flex circuits;high density routing;assembly technologies;high-density flex technology;embedded IC;technology demonstrator;rigid flex demonstrators;technology options;advanced packaging applications;fabrication approach;size 3.0 mum to 5.0 mum;size 20.0 mum to 60.0 mum;size 7.0 mum;frequency 24.0 GHz;frequency 60.0 GHz;Cu;NiAu","","","","15","IEEE","12 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A novel femtosecond laser milling process is utilized for the fabrication of locally suspended membranes of inductors with handler silicon completely etched. Such flexible membranes suspended freely on the BOX show up to 92 % improvement in Q-factor for single turn inductor. The improvement in Q-factor is reported on large sized inductors due to reduced parallel capacitance which allows enhanced operation of inductors at high frequencies. A compact model extraction methodology has been developed to model inductor membranes. These membranes have been utilized for the improvement of noise performance of LNA working in the 4.9 - 5.9 GHz range. A 0.1 dB improvement in noise figure has been reported by taking an existing design and suspending the input side inductors of the LNA circuit.

The process to implement this compartment shielding is ideal for integrating die or wafer level package, and results in miniaturized form factory both in area and in height. The compartment shielding structure is seamlessly connected to the grounding of the substrate, hence has superior isolation performance. The shielding wall which isolates the compartments is made by laser scribing and trench filling. Therefore, the isolation wall can be straight line, L, U or zigzag shape. In addition, the process is flexible to design change, high in shielding effectiveness, and low in cost. A test vehicle was built to verify the performance and shielding effectiveness can be as high as 60dB in up to at least 6 GHz range. Simulation is used to analyze and predict the shielding effect for various filling material, thickness, and over frequency. Moreover, an LTE modem is implemented using this shielding structure.

The flexible-format modulator, which we fabricated with a hybrid configuration of silica planar lightwave circuits and a LiNbO3 chip, enables us to select the format of the output signal from QPSK, 8-level PSK (8PSK), 8-level quadrature amplitude modulation (8QAM) and 16-level QAM (16QAM) just by using static tunable couplers and a phase shifter, without electronic digital-to-analog converters.","1558-4542","","10.1109/JSTQE.2013.2256341","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6509937","Adaptive modulation;integrated optoelectronics;lattice circuit;optical modulation;optical planar waveguides;quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM);quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK)","Lattices;Optical modulation;Phase shift keying;Optical device fabrication;Optical transmitters;Couplers","lithium compounds;optical communication equipment;optical design techniques;optical fibre communication;optical losses;optical modulation;optical planar waveguides;quadrature phase shift keying;silicon compounds","flexible-format modulator;lattice optical modulators;signal-synthesis losses;complementary quadrature-phase-shift-keying;QPSK;higher-order signals;hybrid configuration;silica planar lightwave circuits;8-level PSK;8-level quadrature amplitude modulation;8QAM;16-level QAM;static tunable couplers;phase shifter;LiNbO3","","5","","31","","29 Apr 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Printed circuit board (PCB) lithography, utilizing subtractive etch-and-print techniques to create metal interconnects on PCBs, was the first technique used to create metasurfaces antennas and remains the dominant technique to this day. The development of large-area fabrication techniques that are flexible, precise, uniform, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly is urgently needed for creating next-generation metasurfaces antenna. The present study reports a new fully additive manufacturing method for the fabrication of copper split-ring resonator (SRR) arrays on a PCB as a planar compact metasurfaces antenna. This new method was developed by combining sequential build up (SBU), laser direct writing (LDW), and covalent bonded metallization (CBM) methods and called (SBU-CBM). In this method, standard FR-4 covered with a layer of polyurethane was used as a basic PCB. The polymer surface was coated with a grafting molecule, followed by LDW to pattern the SRR array on the PCB. Finally, in electroless plating, only the laser-scanned area was selectively plated, and copper covalent bond metallization was selectively plated on the SRR pattern. Copper SRR arrays with different sizes were successfully fabricated on PCB using the SBU-CBM method. Copper strip lines within the SRR repeating building block were miniaturized up to 5 μm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the smallest size of a PCB antenna that has been reported to date.","2377-5726","978-1-6654-7943-1","10.1109/ECTC51906.2022.00288","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9816646","metamaterial;RF-energy harvesting;metasurface antenna;copper split-ring resonator;additive manufacturing;laser direct writing;electroless copper plating","Fabrication;Metallization;Two dimensional displays;Plating;Writing;Metasurfaces;Three-dimensional printing","antireflection coatings;copper;laser materials processing;metamaterial antennas;optical fabrication;optical metamaterials;optical polymers;optical resonators;printed circuit manufacture","additive manufacturing;planar compact metasurfaces antenna;laser direct writing;FR-4;electroless plating;laser-scanned area;copper covalent bond metallization;SBU-CBM method;copper strip lines;SRR repeating building block;PCB antenna;split-ring resonator metasurfaces;printed circuit board lithography;copper split-ring resonator arrays;sequential build up;polymer surface;polyurethane layer","","","","21","IEEE","12 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The module utilizes flexible optical waveguides on electrical printed circuit board for data links between high-speed interface devices, such as application processor-to-camera or display module. In this study, flexible and rigid-flex optical electrical circuit boards are used in product emulator designed for in-device optical data links with aggregate data rate up to 120 Gbps (12-ch × 10 Gbps). This paper describes design and fabrication of OE-R/F HDI engine boards with flexible optical interconnect FPCs (OE-FPC); optical coupling methods; chip embedding and assembly procedures; optical engines with 850-nm vertical cavity surface emitting lasers, photo-detectors, and multichannel integrated ICs. Characterization results are given on optical waveguides, I/O couplers, transceiver units, thermal simulations and on selected life-time performance and reliability tests. Low-loss acrylate-based waveguides (~0.0 5dB/cm at 850 nm) are used for OFPCs. Efficient light in/out coupling structures including integrated and embedded 45° mirrors are characterized to meet the target link budget of 10-15 dB at 5-10 Gbps data rate with bit-error-rate (BER) of 10-12. With the chip set used in the test vehicle, the power consumption is approx. 1350 mW for the bi-directional 12-channel 10 Gbit/s/ch optical link (Tx+Rx). This is 112.5 mW per link or 11.25 mW/Gbit/s/link. Bending loss measurements shows that the optical slide flex can be bent down to 2 mm with insignificant increase in loss. Repeatable folding tests indicate of high bend endurance and stability. These results show that our active optical flex module could replace electrical slide or hinge flex and provide high-speed data links free of electromagnetic noise inside typical mobile device configurations.","","978-1-4244-8555-0","10.1109/ESTC.2010.5642837","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5642837","Optical PCBs;optical FPCs;optical waveguides;mobile devices;smart phones","Optical refraction;Optical films;Optical fibers;High speed optical techniques;Optical polarization;Mobile communication","error statistics;integrated optoelectronics;modules;optical fibre fabrication;optical interconnections;optical waveguides;printed circuits;surface emitting lasers","active optical flex module;ultrashort distance data applications;mobile device;flexible optical waveguides;electrical printed circuit board;high-speed interface devices;display module;rigid-flex optical electrical circuit boards;product emulator;in-device optical data links;OE-R-F HDI engine board fabrication;optical coupling methods;chip embedding;vertical cavity surface emitting lasers;multichannel integrated IC;photodetectors;I/O couplers;transceiver units;thermal simulations;reliability tests;low-loss acrylate-based waveguides;OFPC;light in-out coupling structures;bit-error-rate;BER;test vehicle;power consumption;repeatable folding tests;high-speed data links;electromagnetic noise;bending loss measurements;wavelength 850 nm;bit rate 5 Gbit/s to 10 Gbit/s;power 1350 mW;power 112.5 mW;size 2 mm","","1","","15","","22 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This raises a great challenge to the substrate technology and related interconnect technology in electronic packaging for high density, small feature size and high performance. Miniaturization in electronics means finer lines and smaller vias in substrate technology. Very fine lines on the substrate are difficult to produce by thicker copper layer in conventional CO2 laser blind via. In this paper, ultra-fine blind via with solid Cu filled at an entry diameter of 20 mum, over the current blind via size of 50-200 mum by CO2 laser drilling, is demonstrated on polyimide (PI) based flexible substrate. A via pitch at 30 mum for the blind via has been developed for next generation of stack die packaging accompanying with dimpless design, which ameliorates the void entrapment failure caused by soldering and direct flip-chip (FC) bonding, and strengthens interfacial bond strength. In the meantime, thinner Cu conductor at top and bottom side could be achieved for high circuit density. The reliability of the ultra-fine blind vias has been assessed in daisy chain modules at substrate level, subjected to JEDEC air-to-air thermal cycle and thermal shock, and low/high temperature storage tests. Applications in direct FC bonding and their virtues including high electrical and thermal performances, and feasible of various metals surface finishing, will be discussed. In the end, the ultra-fine Cu filled blind via technology has introduced to the production in Compass for SIP, stack die CSP, 2-metal layer chip-on-flex (COF) and multi-layer buildup flex, etc.","","978-1-4244-2739-0","10.1109/ICEPT.2008.4606960","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4606960","Blind via;High-density;flexible substrate;IC packaging","Copper;Substrates;Reliability;Bonding;Surface morphology;Packaging;Lasers","electronics packaging;flip-chip devices;system-in-package","flexible substrate;high density interconnect;BGA;CSP;SIP;electronic packaging;ultra-fine blind via;stack die packaging;soldering;direct flip-chip bonding","","1","","9","","22 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

FPGAs are well suited for expanding into monolithic multiprint systems 2 to 9 times larger (5-10 cm square) we call deciMeter scale integration (DMSI). DMSI expands system capacity, while producing many copies per wafer. Its design criteria is much simpler than the complex wafer scale integration, but still uses defect avoidance routing around flawed blocks to build complete working systems. FPGAs have the main features required for successful DMSI systems: a repeatable cell, built in switchable flexible routing, high connectivity requirements between cell blocks, and flexibility with many potential applications. Modest changes at the periphery of FPGAs chips enables DMSI capability. Laser formed connections and cuts have proven effectiveness in bypassing fabrication time defects and creating defect free working wafer scale systems. The important DMSI criteria for laser defect avoidance is that defect free devices should need no correction. Depending on the DMSI size and current chip yields design defect avoidance requirements vary from simple row column substitution to cell by cell/row column substitution with redundant signal paths.

This article's novelty lies in the following two points: 1) integrating a large aperture scanning mirror and a single-point LiDAR (low cost and widely available) to construct a biaxial scanning LiDAR; 2) proposed a large aperture FPCB mirror using long existing FPCB process such as to achieve low cost. The scanning LiDAR is designed for applications in factory for robots and automated guided vehicles; navigation. The FPCB mirror consists of a mirror plate, two permanent magnets, and a FPCB structure, which includes two torsion beams, a middle seat, and a Flame retardant 4 (FR4) stiffener frame. Four-layer copper coils are embedded in the FPCB structure, which is fabricated using the low cost commercially available FPCB fabrication process. The mirror plate is diced from a thin silicon mirror plate with gold coating and then attached on top of the middle seat of the FPCB structure.

The I - V characteristic and the voltage-dependent impedance of such diode is measured. By using the simulation software Advanced Design System (ADS), we develop a new scalable circuit model consisting of many different elementary diodes, which can explain the measured behavior. The elementary microcone diodes differ electrically in their barrier height, which is modeled as a stochastic process with a Gaussian distribution. A comparison between this model and a single diode model based on the thermionic field emission theory is conducted. We show that the distributed model outperforms the single-diode model in every regard and allows a prediction of the power levels of the harmonic frequency generation. Through more in-depth research, we find that a distributed barrier height leads to a smoother I - V curve, which in turn can lead to higher second and third harmonic power levels.

The radiation has a negative influence on electronics and can lead to the incorrect functioning of complex control and diagnostic system designed for HEP machines. Therefore, in most cases the electronic equipments is installed in radiation-safe areas, but in some cases this rule is omitted to decrease costs of the project. The European X-ray Free Electron Laser (E-XFEL), being under construction at DESY research center, is a good example. The E-XFEL uses single tunnel and part of the electronic system will be installed next to main beam pipe and exposed to radiation. The modern Advanced/Micro Telecommunications Computing Architecture (ATCA/μTCA) standards are foreseen as a base for control and diagnostic system for this new project. These flexible standard provides high reliability, availability and usability for the system which can be decreased by negative influence of parasitic radiation field. The additional shielding will be introduced to protect racks with electronics, but during commissioning and, in case of control systems errors, the assumed radiation levels can be exceeded. Therefore, it is highly recommended to monitor doses absorbed by electronics. Moreover, it could be helpful for estimating system lifetime, scheduling maintenance periods and protecting machine from unexpended failures.

In this paper, we present a general methodology for photometric registration that can deal with multiple different cues. We provide examples for registering RGBD as well as 3D LIDAR data. In contrast to popular point cloud registration approaches such as ICP our method does not rely on explicit data association and exploits multiple modalities such as raw range and image data streams. Color, depth, and normal information are handled in an uniform manner and the registration is obtained by minimizing the pixel-wise difference between two multi-channel images. We developed a flexible and general framework and implemented our approach inside that framework. We also released our implementation as open source C++ code. The experiments show that our approach allows for an accurate registration of the sensor data without requiring an explicit data association or model-specific adaptations to datasets or sensors. Our approach exploits the different cues in a natural and consistent way and the registration can be done at framerate for a typical range or imaging sensor.","2577-087X","978-1-5386-3081-5","10.1109/ICRA.2018.8461049","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8461049","","Three-dimensional displays;Robot sensing systems;Cameras;Iterative closest point algorithm;Minimization;Integrated circuit modeling;Laser radar","image registration;image sensors;mobile robots;sensor fusion","flexible framework;general framework;explicit data association;flexible multicue photometric point cloud registration;mobile robots;mapping systems;recorded sensor data;photometric registration;multiple modalities;image data streams;pixel-wise difference;multichannel images","","7","","22","","13 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The reconfigurable unit is composed of one varactor cascaded by a transmission line (TL) with specific characteristic impedance and electrical length. Each unit can be alternately connected with two cascaded varactors to constitute a T-type structure, where the operating frequency can be selected by providing proper bias voltages for the three varactors. By adjusting the characteristic impedance and electrical length of the transmission line in each unit, the continuous tuning range can be easily extended to exceed 120% tunability.

Optical linear circuit is one of the most important parts for optical quantum computing. The optical circuit, which consists of mode mixers and phase shifters, has been used in various quantum protocols: cluster state generation, Boson sampling, and quantum random walk. To realize a large-scale linear circuit, waveguide-based quantum circuits have experimentally been demonstrated by some groups [1, 2]. However, such a waveguide-based circuit cannot overcome issues of flexibility and loss.On the other hand, recently, a quantum pulse gate (QPG), which enables mode extraction from multimode quantum fields in the frequency domain, has been proposed and experimentally demonstrated [3]. For utilizing the frequency resource of photon field, parallel generations of single photons or multimode squeezed states in the frequency domain, namely time-frequency Schmidt modes, have been demonstrated. In such a wavelengthdivision-multiplexed quantum circuit, this mode extraction corresponds to one row of a linear unitary rotation of the Schmidt modes. It is achieved by sum frequency generation between a spectrally-shaped classical pulse and a quantum weak pulse. The arbitrary mode extraction can be designed by the pulse shaping with a high efficiency. In this report, we propose a multistage QPG which is a simple, flexible and highly efficient quantum linear optical circuit. We devised a novel multipass 4-f system to map the frequency multimode quantum states into the spatiotemporal domain with a single nonlinear crystal (Fig. 1(a)). Furthermore, we show its application to a quantum simulator for calculating molecular vibronic absorption spectra [4] (Fig. 1(b)).","","978-1-5090-6736-7","10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2017.8087378","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8087378","","Photonics;Nonlinear optics;Optical pulse shaping;Optical waveguides;Quantum computing;Time-frequency analysis","optical frequency conversion;optical logic;optical materials;optical phase shifters;optical pulse shaping;optical squeezing;optical waveguides;quantum gates;spatiotemporal phenomena;time-frequency analysis;vibronic states;wavelength division multiplexing","multistage quantum pulse gate;wavelength-division-multiplexed quantum simulator;optical linear circuit;optical quantum computing;mode mixers;phase shifters;quantum protocols;cluster state generation;Boson sampling;quantum random walk;large-scale linear circuit;waveguide-based quantum circuits;multimode quantum fields;frequency domain;frequency resource;photon field;single photons;multimode squeezed states;time-frequency Schmidt modes;wavelength division-multiplexed quantum circuit;linear unitary rotation;sum frequency generation;spectrally-shaped classical pulse;quantum weak pulse;arbitrary mode extraction;pulse shaping;multistage QPG;quantum linear optical circuit;multipass 4-f system;frequency multimode quantum states;spatiotemporal domain;single nonlinear crystal;molecular vibronic absorption spectra","","","","4","","30 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Two types of sensors are mounted on a honeycomb substrate made of flexible photosensitive resin. The proximity sensor consists of several distance sensor arrays, each with 16 laser sensors connected to a microprocessor via an inter-integrated circuit bus. The sensor array is made of a flexible printed circuit, and the distance between the robotic arm and object is measured based on the time-of-flight principle. The tactile sensor consists of multiple 125 mm  $\times125$  mm pressure sensor patches, each integrating 64 piezoresistive pressure sensors. This article presents the design and manufacture of the sensitive skin and proposes the safety control strategies of a nursing robotic arm using sensor information. In particular, by employing proximity sensors to detect approaching objects, the robotic arm can avoid high-speed collisions. The posture of the arm can be adjusted by using the tactile sensors to prevent the patient from slipping off and failure of the robotic arm.

Therefore a high-throughput and low cost testing technique is absolute essential to maintain high quality of final product. We report a Simultaneous Multiple Device Testing (SMuDT) approach which is up to 10 times faster and cost effective than conventional testing methods.

In order to obtain more benefits (higher open-circuit voltages) from the currently passivated rear sides, the implementation of the point contact concept is an intuitive solution. In this article, we present industrial screen-printed point contacts that are metallized with aluminum (Al) pastes containing silicon additives (Si-add). To understand the impacts of the Si-add on the performance our n-PERT-RJ solar cells, the detailed loss analysis on the open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC), and fill factor are performed separately. The effect of Si-add and pitch of laser contact openings (LCO) on the point contact characteristics are also investigated. In the last part, we introduce an innovative “point-line” contact concept on the rear side, which is composed of dot-shaped LCO and Al metal finger design, resulting in an n-PERT-RJ solar cell to reach VOC of 692 mV and peak efficiency of 22%. The 60% bifaciality of the device opens the way for an additional power output on module level, which further reduces the levelized cost of electricity.

To ensure that the various requirements of each network-provider such as customized usage of SOH bytes and affordable circuit scale could be satisfied, a trial circuit board was constructed on the programmable hardware called PROTEUS, which enables flexible operation in terms of code-selection and check bit area. We actually confirm error-correcting capability through the first STM-64 FEC-coded-optical transmission experiment.

Electronics shrinking and scaling technology is the priority of all manufacturers. PCBA Industry is working towards the elimination of solder joints, reduction in use of discrete and bulky components, lowering of assemble span, minimized latency etc. Embedded passive technology is playing a significant role in this roadmap by providing better signal performance, reduced parasitic and crosstalk. In this work, the primary focus is to develop a cost-efficient and flexible fabrication methodology that will be suitable for bulk production. A sequential build up (SBU) procedure is adopted with an additive lithography process to realize the passives with minimum possible feature size (<; 10 μm). A low cost insulating material, promising grafting solution and Laser assisted writing machine with optimized fabrication parameters are the highlights of this production method. A Computer Aided Design (CAD) software i.e. clewin is used during this process to pattern the mask for the entire process. Covalent bonded metallization (CBM) is the key process for the adhesion of copper layer on the desired site of the pattern. In the CBM process, a polymer surface is modified by grafting. The position of the surface modification is optically defined using a laser lithography system. Such surface modified samples are, then treated in an electroless copper process. Resulting in copper metallization only at the locations with a CBM modified surface. The verification of the copper deposition on the substrate is investigated using a high-resolution microscope followed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The confirmation of passive formation has been checked using kethley's source (electrical two-probe measurement). The first-order measured results showed the capacitance formed in the range of 0.3-8 pF. Further concrete measurements using standard methods are undergoing. One of the key advantage of this proposed process is its easiness and feasibility of at room temperature.","","978-0-9568086-6-0","10.23919/EMPC44848.2019.8951871","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8951871","CBM;additive process;embedded passives;grafting material;Urethane coat;LASER patterning;Electroless Copper Plating;SBU process;PCB.","Substrates;Scanning electron microscopy;Optical device fabrication;Production;Lasers;Capacitance","adhesion;copper;electronics packaging;integrated circuit interconnections;masks;metallisation;microfabrication;passivation;photolithography;polymers;scanning electron microscopy;substrates","embedded passive technology;additive lithography process;insulating material;Computer Aided Design software;covalent bonded metallization;copper layer;CBM process;polymer surface;surface modification;laser lithography system;surface modified samples;electroless copper process;copper metallization;CBM modified surface;copper deposition;high-resolution microscope;electron microscopy;passive formation;embedded passives;additive covalent;metallization approach;PCBA Industry;solder joints;discrete components;bulky components;sequential build up;laser assisted writing machine;scanning electron microscopy;SEM;capacitance 0.3 pF to 8.0 pF;temperature 293.0 K to 298.0 K;SBU","","2","","17","","9 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Various optical interconnect schemes have been proposed to take advantage of the high bandwidth capacity and low power consumption offered by optical switching. However, these schemes cannot offer flexible bandwidth sharing due to the large granularity in optical circuit switching, and they require costly optical components. In this paper, we introduce a novel data center network architecture based on cyclic arrayed waveguide grating device and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing technology with parallel signal detection (PSD). This architecture offers flexible bandwidth resource sharing at fine granularity. Other features include high-speed switching, low and uniform latency, and the ability to change the data rates dynamically. By eliminating costly optical components and keeping the core optical router passive and static, the power consumption, hardware cost, and operation cost are reduced. The fine granularity bandwidth sharing and MIMO switching through PSD are verified experimentally. We also propose and evaluate efficient subcarrier allocation schemes to achieve high bandwidth utilization. Finally, we present the implementation of an efficient scheduler for the bandwidth allocation of the proposed scheme.","1558-4542","","10.1109/JSTQE.2012.2209409","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6243168","Data center networks (DCNs);multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM);optical interconnects","OFDM;Optical transmitters;Optical switches;Optical receivers;MIMO;Servers;Signal detection","arrayed waveguide gratings;bandwidth allocation;circuit switching;computer centres;OFDM modulation;optical interconnections;optical signal detection;telecommunication network routing","intra-data center interconnect;data center networks;parallel signal detection;PSD;bandwidth resource sharing;optical circuit switching;cyclic arrayed waveguide grating device;orthogonal frequency division multiplexing;multiple-input multiple-output OFDM;MIMO switching;core optical router;subcarrier allocation;bandwidth allocation","","49","1","35","","18 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Here, Fan-Out Wafer Level Packaging [FOWLP] is one of the latest packaging trends in microelectronics. For FOWLP known good bare dies are embedded into mold compound forming a reconfigured wafer. A redistribution layer is applied on the reconfigured wafer and routes the die pads to the space around and on the die. After bump formation and package singulation by dicing an SMD compatible package is completed. The technology can be also used for multi-chip packages or System in Package (SiP). 3D integration is typically done by package on package (PoP) stacking where the electrical 3D routing is done by through mold vias or vertical interconnect elements [VIE] and a redistribution layer on both sides of the FOWLP. A Foldable Fan-out Wafer Level Package (FFOWLP) would now allow a single sided planar processing and yield a stacked three dimensional package by folding only. Folding can be implemented by a combination of a flexible redistribution layer and a dicing process that only cuts through the molding compound but leaves the redistribution layer untouched. As foldable redistribution layer e.g. polyimide can be used, a standard for flexible substrates. The feasibility of the proposed technology is demonstrated using a multi-chip package. Dies are mold embedded in wafer size. Subsequently the wiring is done by lamination of a polyimide film over the embedded components. In a process flow similar to conventional PCB manufacturing µvias are drilled to the die pads using a UV laser and metalized by Cu-electroplating. Conductor lines and pads are formed by Cu etching. A solder mask can be applied for pad definition. Finally, the wafer will be diced in two steps. First the bending cuts will be done by dicing only through the molding compound and in a second step package singulation will be carried out. Besides folding for package stacking the technology can be also be used to integrate multi-die packages into free form factor surfaces as bows, curves or defined angles. Upscaling of the technology described above from wafer to panel is also possible and offers low cost solutions and large/long foldable FOWLP stripes in a well-defined package.","","978-1-5090-1204-6","10.1109/ECTC.2016.90","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7545405","fan-out wafer level packaging;3D;stacking;folding;through mold via","Three-dimensional displays;Routing;Compounds;Lasers;Wafer scale integration;Silicon;Manufacturing","bending;conductors (electric);electroplating;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit metallisation;laminations;moulding;multichip modules;soldering;system-in-package;vias;wafer level packaging","foldable fan-out wafer level packaging;heterogeneous system integration;large area processing;3D integration;microelectronics;mold compound;reconfigured wafer;die pads;bump formation;package singulation;SMD compatible package;multichip packages;system in package;SiP;package on package;PoP stacking;electrical 3D routing;mold vias;vertical interconnect elements;VIE;FFOWLP;single sided planar processing;stacked three dimensional package;flexible redistribution layer;dicing process;wiring;polyimide film lamination;μvias;UV laser;copper electroplating;metallization;conductor lines;copper etching;solder mask;bending cuts;molding compound;multidie packages;free form factor surfaces;technology upscaling","","8","1","10","","18 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The transmitter contains a vertical-cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) light source operating at 850nm wavelength, an electronics driver chip, and some passive components. The package is suitable for surface mounting. It shows good stability during reflow soldering in an infrared oven with a peak temperature of 250degC. With a special designed heat shield, the SMT module shows a stable optical alignment before and after the reflow soldering process. The SMT technology enables very low cost component mounting on PCB using automatic pick&place machines. The right material selection and package design is crucial for the stability of the optoelectronic module during the surface mount soldering process. The SMT module is a technology extension of our through-hole mounting FOTs. The output power of the transmitter module is limited to 0.7mW to meet eye-safety class 1 requirements. The transmitter has an internal control circuit to stabilize the optical output of VCSEL and an integrated coupling optics to provide loose alignment tolerances of plusmn70um in lateral axis for a working distance of 500um to polymer cladded silica (PCS) optical fiber with 200um core diameter. The optical coupling power from the transmitter to the PCS fiber has a variation within 1 dB over the wide ambient temperature range from -40deg C to +105degC This enables the usage of very low cost plastic molded connector ferrules. The receiver module contains a high speed MSM photodetector. The special design of the MSM photodetector enables high speed operation up to 5Gb/s in combination with a large active area for easy alignment. With two pairs of the fiber optic transceiver modules, we demonstrate a 1Gb/s video transmission over up to 15m of PCS fiber. The video link consists of a camera with an electrical S800 LVDS interface and a high resolution monitor. A pair of fiber optic cable connects the two ports replacing and extending the regular electrical cable. In contrast to the electrical cable the optical fiber is thin, light weight, and highly flexible. The high power budget margin of the link allows 3 in-line connectors for the 10-15m link length. For other applications a longer link length is feasible using higher bandwidth optical fiber. The SMT fiber optic transceivers enable new low cost applications in automotive, industrial control, and home networking. The technology can compete with electrical solutions on performance and cost and can outperform it on cable flexibility and EMI immunity","","1-4244-0552-1","10.1109/ESTC.2006.279983","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4060707","","Optical fibers;Transceivers;Surface-mount technology;Costs;Optical interconnections;Optical transmitters;Optical fiber cables;Optical surface waves;Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers;Optical receivers","integrated optics;moulding;optical cables;optical fibre networks;optical interconnections;optical receivers;optical transmitters;plastics;printed circuits;reflow soldering;shielding;surface emitting lasers;surface mount technology;transceivers","surface mount technology;optical interconnects;plastic molded fiber optic transceiver modules;vertical cavity surface emitting laser;light source;electronics driver chip;passive components;reflow soldering;infrared oven;optical alignment;automatic pick&place machines;material selection;package design;optoelectronic module stability;through-hole mounting;internal control circuit;integrated coupling optics;polymer cladded silica;plastic molded connector;MSM photodetector;video transmission;PCS fiber;video link;camera;electrical S800 LVDS interface;fiber optic cable;electrical cable;automotive;industrial control;home networking;cable flexibility;EMI immunity;0.7 mW;10 to 15 m;200 micron;500 micron;-40 to 105 C;250 C;850 nm","","","","9","","15 Jan 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The microwire arrays are pre-fabricated in ultra-thin carriers using low-cost manufacturing processes such as laser vias and copper electroplating, which are then assembled onto the back of the interposer as a stress-relief interlayer. Such a structure is assembled onto the board using standard SMT processes. The microwire array results in dramatic reduction in solder stresses and strains, even with larger interposer sizes (20 mm × 20 mm), at finer pitch (300-400 microns), without the need for underfill. The parallel wire arrays result in low resistance and inductance, and therefore do not degrade the electrical performance. The scalability of the structures and the unique processes, from micro to nanowires, provides extendibility to finer pitch and larger package sizes. The first part of the paper describes the design of microwire array to meet the thermo-mechanical reliability requirements. Finite element method (FEM) was used to study the reliability of the interconnections to provide guidelines for the test vehicle design. Strip models were built to study the reliability of 400 μm-pitch interconnections with a 100 μm thick, 20 mm × 20 mm silicon interposer that was SMT-assembled onto an organic printed wiring board. The performance of the microwire array interconnection is compared with that of ball grid array (BGA) interconnection, in warpage, equivalent plastic strain and projected fatigue life. A unique set of materials and processes was used to demonstrate the low-cost fabrication of the microwire array. Flexible thermoplastic polyimide films were used as the polymer film carriers for the microwire interconnection structure. In the initial feasibility demonstration, 100 μm thick films with laminated copper foil on both sides of the dielectric were used. A 308 nm excimer laser source was used to ablate the via arrays in the polymer. The microwires were batch fabricated by bottom-up electrolytic plating through the polymer template. A low-cost approach to the microwire fabrication is thus demonstrated by partially releasing the wires with controlled etching of the polymer carrier.","2377-5726","978-1-4799-0232-3","10.1109/ECTC.2013.6575675","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6575675","","Copper;Wires;Strain;Reliability;Silicon;Fatigue","ball grid arrays;copper;electroplating;elemental semiconductors;excimer lasers;finite element analysis;polymer films;printed circuit interconnections;silicon;surface mount technology;thick films","printed wiring board SMT interconnections;copper microwire arrays;thin polymer carriers;coefficient of thermal expansion organic interposers;printed wiring boards;laser vias;copper electroplating;stress-relief interlayer;nanowires;thermo-mechanical reliability;finite element method;FEM;organic printed wiring board;microwire array interconnection;ball grid array interconnection;warpage;equivalent plastic strain;fatigue life;flexible thermoplastic polyimide films;polymer film;thick films;excimer laser source;bottom-up electrolytic plating;microwire fabrication;CTE organic interposers;glass;size 400 mum;size 100 mum;size 20 mm;wavelength 308 nm;Si;Cu","","13","","15","","8 Aug 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The state-of-the-art threshold selection methods perform poorly in segmenting many images with different modalities, such as the magnetic resonance images, cell images, and laser line images. Thus, it is desirable to come up with a more robust method that could segment images with different modalities with the optimum accuracy. To this end, the method should be flexible and its parameters should be adjustable for different types of images. In this paper, we propose to compute the threshold based on the slope difference distribution, which is computed from the image histogram with adjustable parameters. First, the pixels are clustered based on the peaks of the slope difference distribution into different pixel classes. Second, the threshold is selected based on the valleys of the slope difference distribution to separate the pixel classes. The robustness of this threshold selection method relies on the adjustable parameters that could be calibrated to achieve the optimum segmentation accuracy for each specific type of images. The proposed threshold selection method is tested on both the synthesized images and the real images. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods as a whole.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2017.2719122","Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:Y5A1270101); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7956195","Threshold selection;clustering;image segmentation;slope difference distribution","Histograms;Image segmentation;Entropy;Computational modeling;Discrete Fourier transforms;Frequency-domain analysis;Mathematical model","biomedical MRI;image segmentation","image segmentation technology;threshold selection method;magnetic resonance images;cell images;laser line images;segment images;slope difference distribution;image histogram;optimum segmentation accuracy;synthesized images;pixel classes","","19","","30","OAPA","23 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since this new information is made available, we propose to exploit the knowledge of connection holding time, among the other Service Level Specifications (SLS), to improve the routing efficiency. In this work, we consider that a typical electronic-layer (e.g., SDH or MPLS) demand requires only a fraction of the capacity of the single wavelength bandwidth and we investigate a new algorithm for traffic grooming of sub-wavelength connections in an optical mesh network. We rely on the knowledge of the holding time of connection requests to exploit lightpath capacity and hence to achieve significant reduction in blocking probability for the traffic grooming problem.

However, use of conventional MR shows a limitation in the miniaturization trend of electronic devices because of thermal damage to heat- sensitive polymer components from the high process temperature and long bonding time. Furthermore, MR cannot avoid warpage issues because it cannot provide thermal selectivity to the bonding area. These representative problems of MR indicate the need for an advanced bonding process with selectivity and mass product possibility. To meet the requirements of electronic packaging, advanced bonding processes were needed. Laser-assisted bonding (LAB) has been spotlighted as a next-generation interconnection technology to overcome the problems of MR. LAB has extremely fast ramping up speed with accurately controlled wavelength and excellent thermal selectivity. The LAB process could be applied in bonding of flexible, foldable, and even stretchable applications involving a polymer component with a low glass transition temperature. Furthermore, the short process time of LAB could provide not only enhanced productivity, but improvement in mechanical properties as a result of finer grain size and reduction in intermetallic compound (IMC) formation.SAC305 solder paste was printed on two kinds (OSP and ENEPIG) of surface-finished Cu electrode, and MR and LAB processes were performed to create solder joints. The mechanical reliability of solder joint was evaluated with shear test according to the JEDEC standard. Formation and growth of an IMC layer at the interface between SAC solder and Cu after soldering were identified with FESEM. A high- temperature storage test was performed to evaluate the longterm reliability of LAB compared to that of MR. Voids in solder joints were identified by x-ray scanner to compare the soldering processes and surface finish depending on aging time. Smaller IMC layer between solder joint and electrode thickness and fewer voids in solder joints were produced with LAB compared to MR.","2377-5726","978-1-7281-6180-8","10.1109/ECTC32862.2020.00299","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9159282","Laser-assisted bonding;Solder;Microstructure;Intermetallic compound","Soldering;Surface finishing;Aging;Surface cracks;Microstructure;Metals","ageing;bonding processes;copper;copper alloys;electronics packaging;glass transition;grain size;integrated circuit reliability;interconnections;reflow soldering;reliability;silver alloys;soldering;solders;surface finishing;tin alloys;voids (solid)","intermetallic compound layers;laser-assisted bonding;surface finish;mass reflow;MR;interconnecting process;electronic packaging;electronic devices;thermal damage;sensitive polymer components;high process temperature;long bonding time;bonding area;advanced bonding process;mass product possibility;next-generation interconnection technology;thermal selectivity;LAB process;polymer component;low glass transition temperature;short process time;SAC305 solder paste;LAB processes;solder joint;high-temperature storage test;soldering processes;growth kinetics;surface-finished electrode;surface-finished electrode;Cu","","1","","18","","5 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The lightguide-diffusive component is designed for thin direct LED backlighting applications. The LED backlight module is composed of at least an LED light source, a secondary lightguide-diffusive component with a micro-structure reflective bottom surface, and a flexible printed circuit (FPC) for LED lighting without a brightness-enhanced film (BEF). Through this lightguide-diffusive component, the emission profile of a single LED is modified to provide better illumination and more uniformity. In this work, the micro-structure reflective bottom is redesigned to be shaped like a Tetrahedron Reflector Structure Array instead of a triangle cylinder structured array, resulting in a more uniform spatial light energy distribution on the emission plane of the LED backlight. The simulation results show an increase in the uniformity ratio with the new design from 72% to 76%, a 4% improvement, the angle of the luminous intensity is increased from 98 deg to 112 deg, a 14 deg improvement, a decrease in the luminance is from 9024 nits to 8551 nits, an impairment of 5%, and a decrease in the volume of the micro-structure reflector from 1.154 mm3 to 0.767 mm3, a 33.5% volume reduction (cost saving).","1558-9323","","10.1109/JDT.2012.2184077","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6189809","LED;secondary lightguide-diffusive;backlight module;tetrahedron","Arrays;Light sources;Light emitting diodes;Vectors;Mathematical model;Simulation;Lenses","brightness;flexible displays;LED displays;printed circuits","LED backlight module;uniformity characteristics;luminance characteristics;secondary optical lens;wide emission angle;LED light source;secondary lightguide-diffusive component;microstructure reflective bottom surface;flexible printed circuit;brightness-enhanced film;tetrahedron reflector structure array;triangle cylinder structured array;spatial light energy distribution;microstructure reflector;volume reduction","","8","13","8","IEEE","25 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Application of optogenetics in neuroscience studies has created an increased need for the development of light sources and the instruments for light delivery. Currently, laser-coupled optical fibers have been most commonly used, but the tethered optical fibers can restrict the natural behavior of the subjects while performing optical stimulations with freely moving animals. Alternatively, micro-light-emitting diodes (μ-LEDs) are power-efficient, low-cost and suitable for integration with wireless electronics. However, the wide irradiation angle and low out-coupling efficiency of LEDs significantly weaken the emitted light intensity and limit their applications for optical stimulation in deep brain regions. In this paper, we present a micro-lens-coupled LED neural stimulator with improved light out-coupling efficiency for optogenetic neuromodulation. A backside reflector and a frontside microlens are integrated with the μ-LED chip for the light collection and collimation. Microfabrication techniques are developed to construct microlens arrays on mechanically flexible substrates. The functionality of the fabricated LED stimulators is demonstrated by both numerical simulation and measurement.","","978-1-4799-7234-0","10.1109/BioCAS.2015.7348344","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7348344","optogenetics;optical neurostimulation;micro-light-emitting diode;microlens","Light emitting diodes;Lenses;Microoptics;Optical device fabrication;Stimulated emission;Optical reflection;Biomedical optical imaging","biomedical electronics;biomedical equipment;cellular biophysics;genetics;light emitting diodes;light sources;microfabrication;microlenses;neurophysiology;numerical analysis;optical fibres","microlens-coupled LED neural stimulator;optogenetics;fast growing neuromodulation method;genetically-targeted neural cells;millisecond temporal precision;light illumination;light sources;laser-coupled optical fibers;tethered optical fibers;natural behavior;microlight-emitting diodes;wireless electronics;low out-coupling efficiency;emitted light intensity;optical stimulation;deep brain regions;micro-lens-coupled LED neural stimulator;improved light out-coupling efficiency;optogenetic neuromodulation;backside reflector;frontside microlens;μ-LED chip;light collimation;microfabrication techniques;microlens arrays;mechanically flexible substrates;numerical simulation","","6","","17","","7 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the rising complexity of electronic systems, containing more and more both hardware and software parts, it becomes necessary to simulate simultaneously hardware and software parts at whatever abstraction level. These simulation techniques, called co-simulation, require fast and flexible simulators. In this paper we introduce the elaboration of a microcontroller simulator for an accurate hardware/software co-simulation at the clock-cycle level. It is our goal to have a simulator which is fast enough to simulate a few minutes of real time execution within a reasonable lapse of time. To be more precise, we deal here with the realization of a simulator for the ST10 microcontroller and its integration into a co-simulation environment.","","0-7695-0537-6","10.1109/DATE.2000.840875","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=840875","","Microcontrollers;Computational modeling;Circuit simulation;Clocks;Hardware design languages;Switches;Laser sintering;Laboratories;Manufacturing processes;Virtual manufacturing","microcontrollers;digital simulation;circuit simulation;software engineering","cycle-true simulation;ST10 microcontroller;hardware/software co-simulation;clock-cycle level;real time execution;cosimulation environment","","","","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Three design parameters are tested, (1) current collector-electrode interaction, (2) electrode aperture, and (3) distance between parallel electrodes. Noticeable change was observed in the total capacitance upon change in LSG-MSC design which was analyzed in detail using cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and electrostatic simulation using COMSOL Multiphysics. It was found that in addition to electric double layer capacitance, an electric field was generated between electrodes and between electrode and current collector which led to small electrostatic capacitance between them.

The robotic system consists of a mobile robot and a wearable master robot. The elaborated algorithms allow the robot to precisely recognize the shape, boundaries, movement direction, speed, and distance to the obstacle by means of the laser range finders. The designed tactile belt interface receives the detected information and maps it through the vibrotactile patterns. We designed the patterns in such a way that they convey the obstacle parameters in a very intuitive, robust, and unobtrusive manner. The robot movement direction and speed are governed by the tilt of the user's torso. The sensors embedded into the belt interface measure the user orientation and gestures precisely. Such an interface lets to deeply engage the user into the teleoperation process and to deliver them the tactile perception of the remote environment at the same time. The key point is that the user gets the opportunity to use own arms, hands, fingers for operation of the robotic manipulators and another devices installed on the mobile robot platform. The experimental results of user study revealed the effectiveness of the designed vibration patterns for obstacle parameter presentation. The accuracy in 100% for detection of the moving object by participants was achieved.

HSIW has been shown to have some significant advantages for millimeter-wave communications, radar, and sensing systems, but its fabrication can be challenging. To pattern the metallic layers that form the top and bottom HSIW walls, as well as other structures such as microstrip lines and landing pads for integrated circuits and passive components, a subtractive fabrication process using a water-jet laser cutter was employed. To fabricate the dielectric substrate using low-cost Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS), with cavities for the waveguides, a Stratasys PolyJet 3-D printer (Objet 1000) was used. The HSIW components were then assembled using commercially available through-substrate copper transitions, completely eliminating the process of through-substrate via-hole formation and metallization. The manufacturing techniques conventionally used for these vias are generally expensive and intricate at millimeter-wave frequencies. Therefore, the proposed fabrication and assembly process in this article decreases the overall fabrication cost and complexity, and it is shown that this is achieved without compromising the performance of the millimeter-wave HSIW components. The measurement results show that a propagation loss of 13.55 dB/m (0.01355 dB/mm) is achieved for the first HSIW prototype. Based on HSIW structures, it is believed to be among the lowest propagation losses ever reported at these frequencies. The proposed harmonized fabrication and assembly technique also has a strong potential, by combining the advantages of additive and SM techniques, to realize a new class of millimeter-wave components with the possibility of manufacturing conformal and flexible component shapes, based on the materials used.","2156-3985","","10.1109/TCPMT.2022.3181886","King Mongkut’s University of Technology North Bangkok(grant numbers:KMUTNB-64-KNOW-44); Engineering and Physical Science Research Council(grant numbers:EP/S016813/1,EP/N010523/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9792420","Additive manufacturing (AM);millimeter-wave technology;substrate integrated waveguide;subtractive manufacturing (SM)","Copper;Fabrication;Manufacturing;Laser beam cutting;Three-dimensional displays;Millimeter wave technology;Laser beams","ceramic packaging;copper;dielectric waveguides;microfabrication;microstrip lines;millimetre wave circuits;rapid prototyping (industrial);substrate integrated waveguides;three-dimensional printing","subtractive manufacturing;harmonized fabrication;assembly process;additive manufacturing;rapid manufacture;millimeter-wave components;hollow substrate integrated waveguide;millimeter-wave communications;HSIW walls;passive components;subtractive fabrication process;low-cost Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene;HSIW components;through-substrate copper transitions;manufacturing techniques;millimeter-wave frequencies;fabrication cost;HSIW prototype;HSIW structures;conformal component shapes;flexible component shapes;harmonized rapid prototyping","","","","43","IEEE","9 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Pulse-forming lines based on gas spark gap are the main means to generate high-voltage nanosecond short pulses; but due to electrode ablation, it is difficult to operate at MHz repetition rates. The topologies based on the fully controlled semiconductor device can output multimode nanosecond pulse. But it is limited by the gate driver ability and system stray loss, so it is difficult to directly generate flexible and adjustable nanosecond short pulse with MHz repetition rates. In order to overcome the above shortcomings, this article proposes the Blumlein-based LC underdamped oscillation boost circuit and the Blumlein stack topology to achieve high voltage gain. And, the voltage wave process can be adjusted by controlling the switching sequence to change operating mode. Finally, multimode operation such as positive polarity, negative polarity, bipolar and pulse duration modulation can be realized with MHz repetition rates and high gain voltage.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2021.3052943","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51907011); State Key Laboratory of Pulsed Power Laser Technology(grant numbers:6142605190105); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2019CDCGDQ317); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9328613","Blumlein;high frequency;high voltage;multimode;nanosecond pulse generator","Generators;Nanobioscience;Switches;Topology;Pulse generation;Modulation;Oscillators","driver circuits;electrodes;optical pulse generation;photoconducting switches;pulse generators;pulsed power supplies;spark gaps","flexible pulse;adjustable nanosecond short pulse;MHz repetition rates;Blumlein-based LC underdamped oscillation boost circuit;high voltage gain;multimode operation;bipolar pulse duration modulation;high gain voltage;MHz nanosecond rectangular pulse generator;nanosecond short pulse generator;high-energy accelerators;pulsed laser modulation;pulse-forming lines;high-voltage nanosecond short pulses;nanosecond pulse;gate driver ability;system stray loss","","2","","36","IEEE","19 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The strain sensor exhibits an almost linear response to stretching with an average sensitivity of -28.9 fF%-1. The pressure sensor, however, shows a nonlinear and significant hysteresis characteristic due to nonlinear and viscoelastic property of the silicon rubber encapsulation. An average best-fit straight line sensitivity of 30.9 fFkPa-1 was recorded. The sensitivity of shear stress sensor is found to be 8.1 fFkPa-1. The three sensing elements also demonstrate a good cross-sensitivity performance of 3.1% on average.

Future wireless networks aim to connect a significantly greater number of users and devices, while increasing their bandwidth with a tenfold (10 Gbps). To realize this goal, a transition to pico-cells and the use of high-frequency carriers is needed. Realizing such a new access network topology is very challenging and new technologies are needed. Microwave photonics can play a key enabling role, offering unique features such as Radio-over-Fiber, microwave carrier generation and ultra-wide bandwidth filters[1]. The main drawback of this technology is that it relies on bulky and expensive components. This drove the emergence of Integrated Microwave Photonics (IMWP), which combines the functionality of MWP while offering compact and scalable devices. Several systems such as flexible filters and beamforming networks have been demonstrated in IMWP [2], but most of them only with passive components. However, for Radio-over-Fiber applications or optical microwave synthesizers, active components such as laser diodes and amplifiers are needed. InP is the natural platform for this, but cannot offer the same low-loss waveguides as Silicon Photonics. Using hybrid silicon photonics, where InP material is heterogeneously integrated with low-loss Silicon circuits, can offer the best of both worlds.","","978-90-82598-73-5","10.23919/URSI-AT-RASC.2018.8471380","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8471380","","Silicon;Microwave communication;Microwave photonics;Masers;Microwave circuits;Microwave filters","elemental semiconductors;free-space optical communication;III-V semiconductors;indium compounds;integrated optoelectronics;microwave photonics;optical communication equipment;optical fibre networks;radio-over-fibre;silicon","microwave carrier generation;bulky components;expensive components;Integrated Microwave Photonics;IMWP;compact devices;scalable devices;flexible filters;beamforming networks;passive components;Radio-over-Fiber applications;optical microwave synthesizers;active components;hybrid silicon photonics;low-loss Silicon circuits;heterogeneous silicon photonic devices;wireless communication systems;connected society;5G wireless networks;Internet of Things;access network design;pico-cells;high-frequency carriers;access network topology;ultrawide bandwidth filters;low-loss waveguides;InP-Si","","1","","4","","27 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

They are based on newly developed mechanically flexible low-loss silicone waveguides. In addition to meeting the generic requirements of rigid waveguide interconnects, several flex-material challenges were mastered: a) mechanical flexibility permitting waveguide flexing down to radii of 1.0 mm without cracking; b) minimization of waveguide curling induced by the CTE mismatch between flex substrates and polymer layers to enable assembly and connectorization; c) greatly improved cladding adhesion on standard PCB flex substrates, such as polyimide; and d) high environmental stability despite the reduced polymer cross-linking required for better mechanical flexibility. The new waveguides exhibit excellent stability in damp heat (2000 h in 85°C/85% rH) and under thermal shock (500 cycles from -40° to +120°C), and lead-free solder reflow up to 260°C. Using the newly engineered “Dow Corning WG-1017 Optical Waveguide Clad Dev Sample” and the established “Dow Corning WG-1010 Optical Waveguide Core”, we were able to develop a manufacturing process suitable for large areas and offering high process control and stability to produce waveguides having optical loss values of less than 0.05 dB/cm at 850 nm VCSEL wavelength and fulfilling requirements (a) to (d) above.

As a result, for dynamic traffic, the holding time of connection requests can be known in advance. The authors propose to exploit knowledge of connection holding time to design an efficient algorithm, called PHOTO, for the dynamic provisioning of shared-path-protected connections in optical mesh networks. The core idea of the proposal consists of exploiting the knowledge of the holding time of connection requests to minimize resource overbuild (RO) due to backup capacity and hence achieve resource-usage efficiency.

In experiments, the nanolaser shows the enhanced wavelength tunability both under stretching and compressive stress. By investigating the effects of PhC periods and length of the strain shapers, we obtain an optimized lasing wavelength tunability of -13.9 nm under every percentage strain variation in experiments. When further taking the 2nd-order mode in the nanocavity into consideration, we observe a wide lasing wavelength tuning range over 160 nm, which takes only the applied strain Δξtot of ±0.05.

In this study, the three-dimensional (3-D) finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation showed that the crosstalk at a 90/spl deg/-bend with a radius of 0.35-1.75 /spl mu/m is less than -25 dB at a wavelength of 1.55 /spl mu/m. In the experiment, the crosstalk from TE-like to TM-like polarization was evaluated to be -13 dB to -10 dB. This large value was explained by a small tilt of waveguide sidewalls, which seriously increased the crosstalk. In addition, it was found in the calculation that some combinations of bends increase or decrease the crosstalk, and that a U-shape bend is the most effective for the suppression of the crosstalk.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2004.824357","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1278494","","Crosstalk;Wire;Optical waveguides;Optical polarization;Finite difference methods;Time domain analysis;Optical design;Optical devices;Flexible printed circuits;Circuit simulation","optical crosstalk;silicon;elemental semiconductors;optical waveguides;optical design techniques;light polarisation;silicon-on-insulator;finite difference time-domain analysis;optical losses;optical fabrication","polarization crosstalk;microbend;Si-photonic wire waveguide;design flexibility;optical devices;three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain simulation;FDTD;TE-like polarization;TM-like polarization;U-shape bend;Si","","24","","11","","30 Mar 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One of the most demanding fields is the sensing engineering. Meanwhile, the demand for more mechanical flexibility of systems and lower manufacturing budgets is continuously growing. Since the optical transparency is desired for coupling and transmission of optical signals, cost-effective transparent polymeric films are the promising candidates as carrier substrates. In this work, we aim to establish short-distance planar optical interconnects consisting of light sources/detectors and waveguides on the flexible transparent polymeric films for optical sensing functions. To achieve a miniaturized structure and ensure the flexibility of interconnects, bare chips of optoelectronic light sources/detectors are employed. Here, packaging of these chips carries the burden of all responsibilities in terms of ensuring the mechanical strength, electrical connection, thermal stability as well as the optical performance. It leads to the concept of chip-on-flex (CoF) packaging of optoelectronic devices. We present CoF packaging of a bare edge-emitting laser diode using the previously developed novel optodic bonding. While operating CoF packages, the optical performance of an active diode is strongly impaired by inefficient heat dissipation due to the extremely low thermal conductivity of employed polymeric films.

High-resolution flat-panel displays are typically composed of several million individual picture elements (pixels), and in active-matrix displays each pixel contains one or more field-effect transistors that precisely control the pixel brightness during the frame time. For large-area displays on glass substrates, the transistors must be manufactured without the use of high process temperatures, so hydrogenated amorphous silicon or laser-crystallized polycrystalline silicon are often utilized as the semiconductor. If the trend towards increased display resolution, higher frame rates, and greater color fidelity is to continue, field-effect transistors with improved high-frequency performance that can be manufactured on glass substrates will be required. In addition, for the realization of flexible and rollable active-matrix displays, the transistor manufacturing process must be compatible with heat-sensitive polymeric substrates. Finally, the true potential of active-matrix displays will be realized by integrating low-voltage, high-efficiency organic light-emitting diodes with low-voltage, high-frequency nanoscale field-effect transistors on flexible, transparent polymeric substrates.","","978-1-4244-4629-2","10.1109/NEMS.2009.5068777","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5068777","","FETs;Active matrix technology;Substrates;Glass manufacturing;Manufacturing processes;Semiconductor device manufacture;Flat panel displays;Organic light emitting diodes;Brightness;Transistors","","","","","","","","5 Jun 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the photoresist used in this method lacks the key material properties to fulfill the requirements of such applications, including mechanical strength and light trapping efficiency. In this work, we present two hybrid methods to modify the photoresist into micro-concretes.

Both pre- and post- equalization have been used in optical wireless systems to increase data rates. Pre-equalization has the advantage that noise impairments due to equalization can be minimised. However, the variety of pre-equalizer transfer functions, which can be easily created using analog circuits, is limited by the frequency responses of these circuits. Consequently, it may not be possible to equalize some optical wireless links with analog circuit-based pre-equalizers. In this paper a flexible digital pre-equalization scheme that can equalize complex frequency responses is described. The flexibility and the applicability of the scheme is also demonstrated using two example systems, including one that incorporates a fluorescent optical fiber to create a wide-field-of-view receiver for handheld devices. In particular, the bandwidths of the two example systems have been increased to over 500 MHz and to 350 MHz, resulting in at least a three-fold increase in data rate without any post-equalization. The authors believe that this is the first time such significant improvements in on-off-keying data rates have been demonstrated in systems with a relatively complex frequency response and a limited dynamic range.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2021.3125011","Commonwealth Doctoral Scholar at Wadham College; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9600882","Fluorescent concentrators;non single pole responses;optical wireless communications;pre-equalization","Optical transmitters;Bandwidth;Frequency response;Optical receivers;Channel estimation;Optical fibers;Optical fiber communication","analogue circuits;equalisers;fluorescence;frequency response;optical communication;optical links;optical modulation;optical transmitters;transfer functions","data rate;post-equalization;relatively complex frequency response;digital pre-equalizer;optical wireless links;optical wireless systems;pre-equalizer transfer functions;analog circuits;analog circuit-based pre-equalizers;flexible digital pre-equalization scheme;complex frequency responses;fluorescent optical fiber;wide-field-of-view receiver;on-off-keying data rates;frequency 500.0 MHz;frequency 350.0 MHz","","","","34","IEEE","4 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Reel to reel plating is a standard technology for production of thin core flexible material where the substrate is treated as a continuous roll and where material handling is critical to ensure uniform results. The Inpulse 2 system uses insoluble anodes and a novel copper replenishment system to ensure uniform working conditions. The electrolyte agitation is managed by use of frequency controlled pumps which is critical for thin materials to ensure no surface damage during plating. The electrical contact to the substrate is made by the use of large contact area clamps along one edge of the material to be plated. This combination of features in the equipment allow the use of high production current densities even with flexible base materials with thin conductive layers. The clamping system at one edge of the material allows varying foil widths with no further equipment modifications necessary. The use of segmented insoluble anodes with individually controlled rectification is critical for thin flexible production to ensure optimum copper plated surface distribution. Results are shown from the production system being used to copper plate flexible material which is currently in production. The substrate has laser drilled through vias which are metallised and subsequently through hole copper plated in the reel to reel system.","2150-5942","978-1-4244-3623-1","10.1109/IMPACT.2008.4783897","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4783897","","Copper;Conducting materials;Anodes;Contacts;Clamps;Production systems;Technological innovation;Continuous production;Materials handling;Employee welfare","copper;current density;electrical contacts;electrolytes;electroplating;materials handling","horizontal reel-reel copper plating;Inpulse 2 plating system;thin core flexible material;material handling;copper replenishment;insoluble anodes;electrolyte agitation;electrical contact;current density;Cu","","","","3","","13 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, new solutions for automatized network management promise to allow customers to on-line specify the terms of the Service Level Agreement (SLA) to be guaranteed by the service provider. Since this new information is made available, we propose to exploit the knowledge of connection holding time, among the other Service Level Specifications (SLS), to improve the routing efficiency. In this work we consider that a typical electronic-layer (e.g. SDH or MPLS) demand requires only a fraction of the capacity of the single wavelength bandwidth and we investigate a new algorithm for traffic grooming of sub-wavelength connections in an optical mesh network. We rely on the knowledge of the holding time of connection requests to efficiently exploit lightpath capacity and hence to achieve significant reduction in blocking probability for the traffic grooming problem. For a typical US nationwide network, we compare holding-time aware to holding-time-unaware, but otherwise efficient, approaches, obtaining remarkable reduction of blocking probability for practical scenarios.","","978-1-4244-3824-2","10.1109/DRCN.2007.4762265","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4762265","","Telecommunication traffic;Optical fiber networks;Transport protocols;Roads;Flexible printed circuits;Laser sintering;Routing;Synchronous digital hierarchy;Multiprotocol label switching;Bandwidth","multiprotocol label switching;optical fibre networks;synchronous digital hierarchy;telecommunication traffic;wavelength division multiplexing","connection-holding time exploitation;dynamic traffic grooming;optical transport networks;Service Level Agreement;automatized network management;service level specifications;SDH;MPLS;sub-wavelength connections;optical mesh network;US nationwide network;blocking probability reduction;wavelength-division multiplexing","","5","","19","","23 Jan 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Close study of single electronic spins associated with the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond has shown how a complex environment -- in this case a spin-bath formed by carbon-13 isotopic impurities -- may be understood and even controlled. Specifically, we show that optical and microwave excitation of the NV center can be used to perform robust initialization, manipulation, and measurement of the two-qubit register formed by the electronic spin and its nearest-neighbor carbon-13 nuclear spin. These few-qubit registers may be used as a basis for scalable quantum information systems provided that one can identify a means to connect different registers. For an optically active system such as the NV center, photons provide a natural medium for inter- register communication, and we discuss initial experiments studying the possibility of quantum optical interconnects.

Photonic qubit logic provides flexible, low noise scheme for quantum information processing. However, implementation of increasing scale requires numbers of resources beyond what is readily available. A recent demonstration [1] has shown how to add a control operation to existing unitary transformations, providing a practical method for moving to medium-scale quantum circuits. Here we use the entanglement-based version of this scheme to implement a complex quantum gate - the Fredkin, or 3-qubit swap gate - with significantly less resources than its decomposition into a 2-qubit gate array.In the technique proposed in [1], the Hilbert space is expended in order to have a four-level system for each qubit. Each system is composed of a qubit sub-system on which the target operation acts, and a second qubit sub-system, which remains unaffected. The control is added by gates that switch between the different subsystems according to the control qubit. Despite its conceptual simplicity, this technique still uses too many gates for practical implementations with current photonic technology. A more feasible way is a version that replaces the gates with pre-existing entanglement between the gates with qubit system and the second subsystem. The experiment is based on four possible photon pairs -called x, o, s and e - with photons either only in x and e, leading to the swapping, or only in o and s, leading to no swapping (Fig. 1). Each qubit is encoded twice and the two last modes are only used for triggering. The coincidences and the polarization beam splitter on two first mode ensure that the possibilities for the origin of the photons are linked to the state of the control qubit.The four possible photon pairs are encoding in the polarization mode coming from two polarization entangling down-conversion crystals. One crystal give a photon pair either in modes x or o and the second one a pair in mode s or e . We then separate spatially the polarization mode using beam displacer or Sagnac interferometers to preserve the phase stability (Fig . 2) . From the simulation we expect a fidelity around 85% for the truth table.","","978-1-4799-0594-2","10.1109/CLEOE-IQEC.2013.6801703","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6801703","","Logic gates;Quantum entanglement;Quantum computing;Photonics;Communications technology;Educational institutions;Australia","Hilbert spaces;optical beam splitters;optical logic;quantum entanglement;quantum gates;quantum noise;quantum optics;Sagnac interferometers","quantum Fredkin gate;entanglement resource;photonic qubit logic;low noise scheme;quantum information processing;control operation;unitary transformations;practical method;medium-scale quantum circuits;entanglement-based version;complex quantum gate;3-qubit swap gate;2-qubit gate array;Hilbert space;four-level system;target operation;second qubit sub-system;photonic technology;pre-existing entanglement;qubit system;second subsystem;photon pairs;swapping;polarization beam splitter;control qubit state;polarization mode;polarization entangling down-conversion crystals;beam displacer;Sagnac interferometers;phase stability;truth table","","1","","1","","21 Apr 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As an emerging technology, it enables realization of complex RF functionalities beyond the capability of the current all-electronics systems.

Among them, the well-known include signal generation, signal transmission and distribution, signal processing, control, signal measurement and analysis. This technology opens new perspectives for information and communication systems and networks, and it also creates possibilities for new RF applications in both niche and consumer markets. From the industrial perspective, however, the success of MWP solutions, with respect to the conventional all-electronics solutions, is believed to be determined by the progress of photonic integration, where the optical components and subsystems are incorporated in photonic integrated circuits (PICs) [1]. Compared to the MWP systems constructed using discrete optical components, the PIC-based MWP systems, or termed as integrated microwave photonics (IMWP), feature higher robustness and compactness, smaller SWaP, and most importantly, the potential of large reduction on system cost.","","978-1-4799-0594-2","10.1109/CLEOE-IQEC.2013.6801256","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6801256","","Optical waveguides;Broadband antennas;Microwave photonics;Radio frequency;Optical ring resonators","integrated optics;microwave photonics;optical information processing;optical waveguides","communication systems;photonic integrated circuits;signal measurement;signal processing;signal transmission;signal generation;electromagnetic interference;RF frequency transparency;RF engineering;optical components;TRIPLEX waveguide;integrated microwave photonic signal processors","","","","5","","21 Apr 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Monitoring and determining the long-term reliability, and robustness, especially for biomedical application, is crucial.

Based on the previously published data from our group, the scope of this work is to present the ongoing improvements of the process using a low stress polyamic acid based polyimide. The advantage over other organic materials is its low thermal expansion coefficient (CTE), which is close to that of silicon, resulting in reduced stress in the system, particularly, during the manufacturing process. However, unlike benzocylobutene based polymers, polyimide PI2611 shows poor planarizing behavior, leading to more inhomogeneous substrate layers and thus, affecting process steps, such as, photolithography, silicon chip embedding, metal etching, via opening and, direct laser writing, especially in terms of accuracy. To address those issues, we have investigated the homogeneity of multiple polymer layers using both spectroscopic reflectometry and surface profilometry.

The PNB waveguide has extremely low optical loss of 0.03 dB/cm at wavelength of 830-nm and high glass transition temperature (Tg) of 270°C. The PNB waveguide can be formed by only UV irradiation step without both etching and developing processes. By using this method, the waveguide can be easily patterned with various shapes such as Y-branch, bend, taper, and so on. In addition, we can fabricate the minimum waveguide pitch less than 75 μm with the 50-μm-width core. We can also easily fabricate a stacked waveguide because the core layer with flat surface can be formed without an etching and a developing process. In the PNB waveguide, 45° mirror was formed by an excimer laser. This method provides a small mirror (100 μm × 200 μm) with smooth surface in respective waveguides. From the result of insertion loss measurements, total optical loss was less than 2 dB in an 8-cm-length waveguide with two 45° mirrors. Furthermore, new Opto-Electric (O-E) interconnection with PNB optical waveguide was proposed. This PNB waveguide has high flexibility and high adaptability to reflow soldering process because of its high Tg. Therefore, the PNB waveguide can be formed in flexible printed circuit boards (PCBs) without particular process, as compared to the conventional PCB fabrication process, which leads to low cost O-E interconnection.","","978-1-4244-1130-6","10.1109/POLYTR.2007.4339166","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4339166","Optical waveguide;Polynorbornene (PNB);45° mirrors;Opto-Electric (O-E) interconnection","Optical waveguides;Optical interconnections;Optical polymers;Integrated circuit interconnections;Optical losses;Mirrors;Etching;Surface waves;Optical surface waves;Optical waveguide components","optical interconnections;optical polymers;optical waveguides","temperature 270 degC;wavelength 830 nm;flexible printed circuit boards;reflow soldering process;excimer laser;stacked waveguide;UV irradiation step;high glass transition temperature;low optical loss;multimode polymer optical waveguide;optoelectric interconnections;high performance polynorbornene optical waveguide","","3","2","10","","8 Oct 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our recent work shows that reducing the subgap density of states (DOS) at the channel can also help to achieve low-voltage OTFTs. This approach does not need large gate dielectric capacitance, and thus a low- k and thick gate dielectric layer can be used. In this work, device/circuit mixed-mode simulations are carried out to compare the performance of the two type low-voltage OTFTs as switches in active-matrix backplanes. It is shown that the low-voltage OTFT with reduced subgap DOS can achieve faster charging and discharging.

It delivers the gate-drive power by laser light via optical fiber over a long distance (>1 m), so a high isolation voltage (>20 kV) is achieved, and the circuit size and weight are reduced. More importantly, it eliminates the parasitic CM capacitance coupling the power stage and control stage, and thus eradicates the control signal distortion caused by high dv/dt in switching transients of the high-voltage SiC devices. In addition, the gate drive circuit design integrates comprehensive protection functions, including the over-current protection, under/over-voltage lockout, gate-clamping, soft turn-off, and fault report.

We simulate the proposed specific graphene-silicon solar cell layer assembly by using the 2-D FEM under the standard global AM1.5 spectrum conditions. The generation of strong magnetic resonance field arises due to graphene sheet covered on top of gold nanograting and specific dielectric spacer thickness and slit period and leads to increase absorption and transport of charge carriers in p-i-n silicon layer sandwiched between dielectric spacer and back contact. We report that absorption improvement can be simply tuned by adjusting few geometric parameters of proposed device and maximum absorption is achieved up to 80% in near-infrared wavelength ranges. As an outcome, maximum short circuit current density (Jsc) of 32 mA/cm2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.45 V, and calculated power conversion efficiency of 10.5% are achieved without chemical doping of graphene. The proposed simple structure configuration of silicon thin-film solar cell with graphene on top offers flexible tuneability, high short circuit current values, and increased optical absorption that are beneficial for practical fabrication and industrial applications.","1558-1713","","10.1109/JQE.2018.2877185","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8502154","Au nanograting;magnetic resonance excitation;maximum absorption;graphene/silicon solar cell;high current density;strong field coupling","Graphene;Absorption;Metals;Photovoltaic cells;Silicon;Conductivity;Dielectrics","current density;elemental semiconductors;finite element analysis;gold alloys;graphene;light absorption;magnetic resonance;nanofabrication;nanostructured materials;Schottky barriers;short-circuit currents;silicon;silver alloys;solar cells","open-circuit voltage;near-infrared wavelength;magnetic resonance field;standard global AM1.5 spectrum;2D FEM;back silver contact;carrier recombination;2D Au-Ag nanograting;graphene-silicon Schottky junction complexity;graphene-silicon solar cell layer assembly;short circuit current density;dielectric spacer thickness;optical absorption;p-i-n silicon layer;gold nanograting;graphene sheet;silicon thin-film solar cell structure;complex manufacture processes;Schottky junction configurations;silicon thin-film solar cell nanostructure;light-matter interaction;voltage 0.45 V;efficiency 10.5 percent;Au-Ag;Si","","6","","57","IEEE","21 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although lots of OAWG schemes were reported using mature fiber grating techniques, one of the most promising solutions is prone to be the miniaturization and integration with photonic integrated circuits, such as using indium phosphide (InP) platform, silica on silicon, silicon nitride or silicon platform. In this talk, we review our recent progress on some OAWG schemes using silicon platform and their applications in photonic computing. First, we report an OAWG and high-order photonic differentiator based on a four-tap FIR silicon integrated circuit. By thermally controlling the amplitude and phase of each tap, we obtain several typical waveforms such as triangular waveform, sawtooth waveform, square waveform and Gaussian waveform, etc. Furthermore, we demonstrate first-, second- and third-order differentiation based on the optical pulse shaper, whose spectra were tailored to the transfer functions of temporal differentiators. Especially, our scheme can switch the differentiator patterns from first- to third-order freely on a fixed photonic chip, and this is unable in our previous works such as cascaded microrings or cascaded Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs). Second, we demonstrate radio-frequency arbitrary waveform generation using temporal synthesis. We compare two schemes of cascaded microring resonators and finite impulse response. There functional photnic chip has only millmeter size, low power consumption, and high frequency response. Third, we will demonstrate an OAWG scheme based on superposition of differentiated waveforms. Compared to the first two schemes, this one shows a more compact size and a more flexible operation.","","978-1-5090-6093-1","10.1109/PIERS.2016.7734243","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7734243","","Optical resonators;Silicon;Optical interferometry;Optical pulse shaping;Laser radar;Photonics;Optical pulses","elemental semiconductors;FIR filters;function generators;integrated optics;micromechanical resonators;optical pulse shaping;silicon","on-chip arbitrary waveform generator;review;silicon platform;photonic computing;high-order photonic differentiator;four-tap FIR silicon integrated circuit;triangular waveform;sawtooth waveform;square waveform;Gaussian waveform;optical pulse shaper;transfer functions;fixed photonic chip;radio-frequency arbitrary waveform generation;temporal synthesis;cascaded microring resonators;finite impulse response;Si","","","","","","10 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper introduces the SCM-BSN concept, describes a prototype system that has been built at GTE Laboratories, and describes some possible evolutionary scenarios to integrated digital services. While the SCM-BSN prototype system has been designed to provide voice, data, and switched video services using FM-video modulation, the BSN design has been structured to provide for a graceful evolution to other broad-band services including HDTV, digital video, and integrated broad-band services based on ATM transmission.

These detectors are used in a large variety of scientific applications, ranging from X-ray astronomy to the new X-ray Free Electron Laser sources. The main concept of VERITAS is to provide a flexible readout chip able to cope not only with different kinds of detectors, but also with a large set of operating conditions that may require very different noise thresholds and input dynamic ranges. These can vary by more than two orders of magnitude. Every analog channel of VERITAS provides trapezoidal weighting function. This filtering strategy had never been applied to the pnCCD before. The very first measurements obtained coupling VERITAS with a 128×256 pnCCD are shown. With these settings an input charge up to 2.5×105 electrons can be processed. With a readout time of 4 μs/line a noise of 3.9 electrons has been measured in the highest gain mode. The resolution obtained on the Mn-Kα peak of a 55Fe source is of 136 eV for single events. A noise of 30 electrons has been achieved in the lowest gain mode at a speed of 6.4 μs/line. In this low gain setting an input charge up to 2.5×105 electrons can be processed. These striking results fulfill the requirements of the main foreseen applications of large-size pnCCDs: experiments with Free Electron Lasers and high-speed optical astronomy. In order to further improve the performance and the flexibility of the ASIC, a second version based on a fully differential architecture has been designed. This topology allows a simpler filter implementation and it is less sensitive to cross-talk. In addition it offers the possibility to switch with the same ASIC between the source follower and drain current readout of the DEPFET sensors. The drain readout should make it possible to reach a processing time of about 2-3 μs/line with an electronics noise ≤10 el. This makes the second version of VERITAS very attractive for the proposed ESA X-ray astronomy mission ATHENA.","1082-3654","978-1-4673-0120-6","10.1109/NSSMIC.2011.6154301","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6154301","","Extraterrestrial measurements;Anodes;CMOS technology;Size measurement;Preamplifiers;CMOS integrated circuits;Capacitance","application specific integrated circuits;CCD image sensors;field effect transistors;readout electronics;X-ray apparatus","ASIC;pnCCD readout;DEPFET array readout;X-ray imaging;X-ray spectroscopy;X-ray FEL;MPI-Halbleiterlabor;flexible readout chip;VERITAS analog channel;trapezoidal weighting function;55Fe Mn-K-alpha peak;large size pnCCD;high speed optical astronomy;fully differential architecture;source follower;drain current readout;DEPFET sensors;X-ray astronomy mission;ESA ATHENA mission","","","","11","","20 Feb 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Especially for wearable and flexible IoT electronics, which are commonly integrated by transfer printing process, organic-inorganic bonding is indispensable for the integration of diverse electronic components. Existing hybrid bonding technologies like laser-assisted bonding or friction stirring welding achieve organic-inorganic bonding using high temperatures as high as melting point of polymers; however, these causes severe material deterioration. Thus, hybrid bonding must be achieved at low temperatures. Here we report a novel hybrid bonding method at the solid-state level and under the atmospheric pressure. Inorganic materials like tin were bonded to polyimide via the ethanol-assisted vacuum ultraviolet (E-VUV) irradiation process, where specimen surface were exposed to a vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV)-irradiated ethanol vapor atmosphere before bonding. VUV-induced re-assembly of ethanol vapor molecules was used to develop hydroxyl-carrying alkyl chains through coordinatively-bonded carboxylate onto tin, whereas numerous hydroxyl-carrying alkyls were created on polyimide. Triggering dehydration via these hydroxyls by merely heating to 150 °C for a few minutes produced robust organic-inorganic reticulated complexes at the tin/polyimide interface. Interface observation via transmission electron microscopy (TEM) shows that the bonded tin/polyimide was extremely compact without readily visible voids. A great number of nano-grains of organic-inorganic complexes were observed in the polyimide side but located ca. 35 nm away from the initial interface, indicating that tin interdiffusion into the polyimide side occurred during hybrid bonding and thus enhanced bondability. The hybrid interface is believed robust due to the strong organic-inorganic nano-grains. Finally, the E-VUV process was experimentally proven to possess broad applicability to diverse inorganic materials, such as aluminum, iron, titanium, and silicon. Adhesion mechanism of E-VUV process was proposed in this study. The E-VUV bonding strategy is expected to be utilized in micro-assembly of flexible and wearable/implantable IoT electronics.","2377-5726","978-1-7281-1499-6","10.1109/ECTC.2019.00042","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8811115","human-machine interaction;wearable devices;heterogeneous integration;organic-inorganic bonding;direct bonding","Bonding;Surface treatment;Tin;Radiation effects;Ethanol;Inorganic materials;Substrates","adhesion;adhesive bonding;bonding processes;bonds (chemical);heat treatment;infrared spectra;integrated circuit bonding;materials preparation;melting point;nanofabrication;organic compounds;organic-inorganic hybrid materials;polymers;scanning electron microscopy;silicon;silicon compounds;surface treatment;transmission electron microscopy;ultraviolet radiation effects;voids (solid)","numerous hydroxyl-carrying alkyls;organic-inorganic reticulated complexes;organic-inorganic complexes;polyimide side;organic-inorganic nanograins;E-VUV process;E-VUV bonding strategy;diverse organic-inorganic integration;IoT devices;material hybridization;wearable IoT electronics;flexible IoT electronics;transfer printing process;organic-inorganic bonding;hybrid bonding technologies;laser-assisted bonding;ethanol-assisted vacuum ultraviolet irradiation process;vacuum-ultraviolet-irradiated ethanol vapor atmosphere;hydroxyl-carrying alkyl chains;hybrid bonding method;material deterioration;pressure 1.0 atm;temperature 150.0 degC;size 35.0 nm","","","","27","","26 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The structure of the bonding portion is composed of Au bumps having two-stepped construction and conductive adhesives. The conductive adhesive is very flexible in bond, thus relaxing thermal and mechanical stresses. The ALIVH/sup TM/ substrate has been developed in our laboratory. It is a high density and high performance multi-layered printed wiring board with any layer inner via hole structure, via hole processing technology using a CO/sub 2/ laser and interconnection technology that employs conductive paste. We had good results for several reliability tests in the test vehicles of MCM-ALIVH/sup TM/.

To produce high volume, high-density interconnect substrates, flexible printed circuits (FPCs) will become more and more important. For the fabrication of FPCs, polyimides (Pis) possess many outstanding properties, such as high thermal stability, good mechanical strength, low dielectric constants, and superior chemical resistance in acidic environments.[1] To metalize PI surfaces, there are many processes such as physical vapor deposition, chemical vapor deposition, plasma modification, laser modification have been proposed2. In consideration of the costs, a wet process seems to be a good approach because of lower expense and higher deposition rate. In this study, copper metallization on polyimide films was carried out via a wet chemical process. This process included the chemical reaction of KOH with PI, ion exchange of doped K+ with Ni2+, doped Ni2+ reduction by aqueous dimethylamine borane (DMAB) to form nickel nanoparticles (NNPs), and electroless copper (ELC) deposition catalyzed by NNPs film. Here, nickel is chosen to be the catalysts for triggering off electroless copper plating deposition instead of commonly-used expensive palladium catalyst. Furthermore, nickel also serves as barrier layer to avoid copper diffusion into polymer, causing destruction of adhesion. Some additives are added into the DMAB solution for facilitating the oxidation of DMAB and then releasing electrons to nickel ions doped in PI, accelerating charge transfer to doped ions to form continuous NNPs film which blocks the diffusion of reductant into PI. Owing to the additive's assistance, faster charge transfer causes faster diffusion of nickel ions to the PI surface and less nickel ions remaining in PAA. Besides, continuous and dense NNPs film is formed without heat treatment due to the addition of the additive in the DMAB solution. The modified NNP has better catalytic activity for electroless Cu plating. As to the relationship among additive, reductant and formation of NNPs, X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM), etc are employed for characterization, respectively.","2150-5942","978-1-4244-9786-7","10.1109/IMPACT.2010.5699514","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5699514","","Artificial neural networks;Films;Additives;Ions;Copper;Nickel;Surface treatment","catalysts;charge exchange;copper;electroless deposition;field emission electron microscopy;ion exchange;metallisation;nanofabrication;nanoparticles;nickel;oxidation;scanning electron microscopy;transmission electron microscopy;X-ray photoelectron spectra","copper metallization;polyimide films;wet chemical process;chemical reaction;ion exchange;aqueous dimethylamine borane;catalysts;electroless copper plating deposition;barrier layer;oxidation;charge transfer;catalytic activity;X-ray photoelectron spectrometry;XPS;field emission scanning electron microscopy;FESEM;cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy;TEM;nickel nanoparticle formation;Cu;Ni","","","","3","","20 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Sensors must operate in off-nominal conditions; uneven and slippery terrains make wheel odometry inaccurate, while long corridors without salient features make exteroceptive sensing ambiguous and prone to drift; finally, spurious loop closures that are frequent in environments with repetitive appearance, such as tunnels and mines, could result in a significant distortion of the entire map. These challenges are in stark contrast with the need to build highly-accurate 3D maps to support a wide variety of applications, ranging from disaster response to the exploration of underground extraterrestrial worlds. This paper reports on the implementation and testing of a lidar-based multi-robot SLAM system developed in the context of the DARPA Subterranean Challenge.

The application for which this system is proposed is an implantable multi-contact active nerve electrode for the treatment of epilepsy via vagus nerve stimulation. Although intended for implanted integrated systems, this technology may be applied across a range of devices requiring hermetic or vacuum sealing and through wafer interconnection. The proposed embodiment of this method features a 2-channel mixed signal ASIC (records and stimulates neural activity), bump bonded directly onto solid gold electroplated through wafer interconnects on a carrier wafer. The silicon encapsulation wafer is bonded to the carrier wafer using a direct bond for which strength and hermeticity are achieved by activating surfaces with free radicals prior to bonding. This bond is annealed to full strength at 200?? ensuring no damage to the ASIC. Onto the back of the packaged wafer, a layer of PDMS is spin coated and flexible, low resistance active circuits and electrodes are metallised using excimer laser ablation and selective plating in an autocatalytic platinum bath. The circuits are encapsulated in a further layer of PDMS before dicing. Solid electroplated through wafer interconnects (aspect ratio 5) enable hermetic interconnection of direct bonded packages with low connection impedance, offering benefits across a range of packaging applications. Many of the processes used in this construction will have wider applicability in wafer level packaging.","","978-3-8007-3081-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5760518","","Electrodes;Application specific integrated circuits;Packaging;Integrated circuit interconnections;Cavity resonators;Platinum;Gold","","","","1","","","","1 Jun 2011","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

The AWG has been the key to the construction of flexible and large-capacity WDM networks. This is because, compared with conventional filters consisting of thin-film interference filters and microoptics, the AWG offers the advantages of low loss, high port counts, and mass productivity. To improve such characteristics further, low-loss, higher index-contrast (super-high /spl Delta/) planar lightwave circuits (PLCs) with a bending radius of 2 mm have recently been developed. It has been shown that these PLCs are effective for use in constructing a compact AWG module with 1/5 the volume of a conventional module and large-scale AWGs with 256 and 400 channels. Three techniques for low-loss fiber connection with spot-size converters have also been developed for the super-high /spl Delta/ PLCs, and it has been confirmed that these techniques can be applied to the fabrication of AWG modules. Furthermore, two-stage tandem AWG-type multi/demultiplexers with more than 1000 channels have been demonstrated. This paper describes the progress that has been made on these high-density and large-scale AWGs, which are expected to contribute greatly to the construction of future photonic networks including optical add/drop multiplexing systems and optical crossconnect systems.","1558-4542","","10.1109/JSTQE.2002.805965","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1176648","","Large-scale systems;Programmable control;WDM networks;Optical filters;Optical fiber networks;Wavelength division multiplexing;Thin film circuits;Interference;Microoptics;Optical losses","silicon compounds;integrated optoelectronics;arrayed waveguide gratings;wavelength division multiplexing;optical fibre networks;modules;multiplexing equipment;demultiplexing equipment;optical fibre losses","high-density large-scale arrayed-waveguide- grating multi/demultiplexers;wavelength division multiplexing;WDM-based photonic networks;low loss;high port counts;mass productivity;index-contrast planar lightwave circuits;bending radius;compact AWG module;large-scale AWGs;low-loss fiber connection;AWG modules;photonic networks;optical crossconnect systems;add/drop multiplexing systems","","154","1","37","","19 Feb 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the paper the ink-jet printing technology is proposed for creating the conductive layers of microvias. The interconnection process made by ink-jet printing seems to be very promising because of the same technique can be used for making planar as well as vertical connections in flexible substrates. The holes with diameter from 30 to 60 μm were drilled by laser beam in the polyimide substrates with a thickness of 100 μm and then filled by ink-jet printing. Two types of inks with nanosilver were used. One of them contains silver particles with a very narrow size distribution (from 4 to 10 nm) and needs high temperature for sintering, the second - with much higher silver particles size (tens of nm), but lower temperature to be electrically conductive. The experiments shows, that it is possible to achieve acceptable resistance of microvias.","1944-9399","978-1-4673-2200-3","10.1109/NANO.2012.6322108","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6322108","","Manganese;Ink;Polymers;Printers;Color;Viscosity;Substrates","ink jet printing;integrated circuit interconnections;nanoparticles;particle size;polymers;silver;sintering;vias","interconnection process;ink jet printing method;ink jet printing technology;microvia conductive layer;vertical connection;flexible substrate;drilling;laser beam;polyimide substrate;nanosilver;silver particle;sintering;silver particles size;electrically conductive;microvia resistance;size 30 mum to 60 mum;size 100 mum;size 4 nm to 10 nm","","5","","18","","4 Oct 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the big challenges in thermal modeling is the unknown material properties of many of electronic components. The paper describes the approach adopted to measure the thermal conductivity of flexible laminated layers commonly used in electronic applications. The small thickness, coupled with low thermal conductivity of the base material involved, makes the measurement of in-plane thermal conductivity challenging. Standard procedures like ""laser flash"" technique are not suitable due to the large uncertainty involved. A methodology was developed to measure the thermal conductivity of a 100 microns thick flex structure. An experimental set up was created wherein a temperature gradient was established across the flex layer and measured. A numerical model simulating the experimental conditions was created. Radiation and convective boundary conditions estimated by analytical means were imposed upon the model. By adjusting the thermal conductivity in the numerical model, the experimental temperature profile was matched with the numerical profile. The adjusted thermal conductivity was taken to be the thermal conductivity of the flex. Finally, an uncertainty analysis was performed and uncertainty bands were obtained for the thermal conductivity.","","0-7803-8357-5","10.1109/ITHERM.2004.1319161","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1319161","","Thermal conductivity;Conductivity measurement;Transistors;Substrates;Thermal management of electronics;Performance analysis;Thickness measurement;Temperature;Numerical models;Uncertainty","laminates;substrates;thin films;thermal conductivity measurement;convection;heat radiation;finite element analysis;thin film circuits","thermal conductivity;thin film composite substrates;thermal analysis;heat transfer;fluid flow analysis;thermal modeling;electronic component;flexible laminated layers;laser flash;flex structure;temperature gradient;convective boundary condition;radiation boundary condition;temperature profile;uncertainty band;uncertainty analysis;CFD softwares","","1","","10","","9 Aug 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A naval DC IPS will include multiple power generation devices, energy storage devices, and layered power converters. Power converters coupled to high-bandwidth regulators exhibit constant power load (CPL) behavior. CPLs exhibit negative non-linear impedance which reduce stability margins and limit the efficacy of linear control methods. Incorporating megawatt level pulsed loads, such as laser weapons or railguns, challenges the limits of linear control methods. A recently introduced control scheme, Adaptive Select-Matrix LQR (LQR-SM), is a flexible and adaptable centralized control approach to multi-input, multi-rate, high order systems. This paper presents a comparative study of LQR-SM controller performance in a naval medium-voltage DC shipboard electric distribution system with CPLs. The four configurations studied are a full-order adaptive LQR-SM controller, two adaptive reduced-order controllers, and a non-adaptive full order controller. The controllers are compared on the basis of quality of regulation, size of region of attraction (ROA), computation load, and stored-energy efficiency.","","978-1-5090-4944-8","10.1109/ESTS.2017.8069276","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8069276","MVDC;constant power load (CPL);hybrid energy storage system (HESS);linear quadratic regulator (LQR);adaptive;non-linear;all-electric ships","Integrated circuit modeling;Mathematical model;Load modeling;Computational modeling;Energy storage;Adaptation models;Voltage control","adaptive control;linear quadratic control;marine power systems;nonlinear control systems;power convertors;power system control;power system stability;railguns;reduced order systems;ships;weapons","reduced order multirate LQR controllers;MVDC shipboard electric distribution system;constant power loads;DC integrated power systems;naval DC IPS;multiple power generation devices;energy storage devices;power converters;high-bandwidth regulators;constant power load behavior;CPLs;nonlinear impedance;linear control methods;laser weapons;railguns;Adaptive Select-Matrix LQR;flexible control approach;adaptable centralized control approach;high order systems;LQR-SM controller performance;naval medium-voltage DC shipboard electric distribution system;full-order adaptive LQR-SM controller;adaptive reduced-order controllers;order controller;computation load;warships;US Navy investment;megawatt level pulsed load","","1","","8","","19 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper covers design-for-manufacturability decisions relating to that design, as well as equipment and processes that were created specifically for the purpose of manufacturing this oscillator Special precision plating techniques are used to hold calibration tolerance to below 1 part in 10/sup 6/. The crystal parameters are then carefully measured over temperature in an oil bath. The measured crystal data is put through an algorithm to determine necessary manufacturing parameters. A laser-operated bar code engraving system marks the individual crystals. Statistics on large numbers of crystals are recorded in a database and used to adjust the manufacturing process as necessary to maintain extremely tight angle-of-cut tolerances to hold turnover temperatures within a relatively narrow range. The next step is to install the crystal in a ""bridge"" PC board. Finished bridge boards, with crystals, are then plugged into oscillator boards that are installed in oven assemblies. The exact turnover temperature is determined and errors such as thermistor tolerance are calibrated out. This information is added to the database that is used later to store the oven set point data in nonvolatile RAM on the controller board that holds the puck assembly. Tolerancing issues of the extremely high thermal gain oven are described. Great attention must be paid to the fabrication of the flexible circuit heaters for the oven mass. Another critical parameter is the ratio of heat applied to the top and bottom of the oven mass vs. the rim. We elected to choose a single value used for all ovens, which limited the thermal gain achieved in production to the neighborhood of about 100,000. A technique is described that we could have used, if necessary, to individually set the thermal gains of the ovens to approach 1,000,000.","1075-6787","0-7803-5838-4","10.1109/FREQ.2000.887360","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=887360","","Oscillators;Ovens;Crystals;Manufacturing processes;Temperature measurement;Databases;Assembly;Pulp manufacturing;Calibration;Petroleum","crystal oscillators;electron device manufacture;calibration;temperature control;design for manufacture","balanced-bridge controlled crystal oscillator;precision plating;crystal data;laser-operated bar code engraving;database;angle-of-cut tolerances;turnover temperatures;PC board;bridge boards;oscillator boards;oven assemblies;turnover temperature;thermistor tolerance;crystal plating;flexible circuit heaters;ratio of heat;thermal gain;ovens;tuning;ageing;holdover prediction","","","","9","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since the approach doesn't rely on enlarging the gate dielectric capacitance, the low voltage OTFT with a relatively thick dielectric layer was shown to be able to sustain high voltage operation. Moreover, the ultra-small dielectric capacitance can help to reduce the parasitic capacitance in the data and scan lines of the display panel. The device technology is shown to be promising for developing flexible/rollable display systems on plastic substrates, where a relatively high voltage is required for the pixel driving circuits, and a low voltage is preferred for the logic circuits in the peripheral drivers.","1558-9323","","10.1109/JDT.2014.2344040","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6868195","Organic thin-film transistor (OTFT);solution processed;low temperature;low voltage;high voltage","Organic thin film transistors;Dielectrics;Logic gates;Low voltage;Educational institutions","organic field effect transistors;phase separation;thin film transistors","thick dielectric layer;ultra-small dielectric capacitance;parasitic capacitance;display panel;plastic substrates;display systems;pixel driving circuits;logic circuits;peripheral drivers;gate dielectric capacitance;ultra-thin high crystalline channel;polystyrene;phase separation;6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl)-pentacene;channel engineering approach;solution processed bottom-gate bottom-contact organic thin-film transistors;OTFTs;hybrid low-high voltage operation","","10","","19","IEEE","30 Jul 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An important goal of the NGI project is to support bandwidth-on-demand services with quality-of-service (QOS) guarantee over WDM networks. As a first step toward this goal, we have developed several fast scheduling algorithms for flexible bandwidth reservations and fair sharing of unreserved bandwidth in a WDM broadcast network with fast-tunable transceivers. Unlike circuit-based bandwidth reservation schemes that impose a fixed schedule precomputed on setup, our scheme deals with bursty traffic by allocating network resources dynamically using very efficient algorithms. Our algorithms are based on a new concept of computing maximal weighted matchings, which is a generalization of maximal matchings on unweighted graphs. We prove that our algorithms can support total reserved bandwidth of up to 50% of the network capacity, and in that case constant delay bounds are also established. Simulations show that our algorithms can in practice support much higher reserved bandwidth-up to 90% of network capacity, and with much better delay bounds, even for burst traffic. In addition to the bandwidth guarantee, the unreserved bandwidth can be shared fairly among the users using our fair access algorithms with case to 100% network utilization in simulations.","1558-2213","","10.1109/50.736593","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=736593","","Wavelength division multiplexing;Broadcasting;Local area networks;Bandwidth;WDM networks;Scheduling algorithm;Telecommunication traffic;Next generation networking;IP networks;Quality of service","wavelength division multiplexing;optical fibre LAN;transceivers;optical transmitters;optical receivers;optical tuning;telecommunication traffic","cell switching WDM broadcast LAN;bandwidth guarantee;fair access;cell-switching wavelength division multiplexing local area network;LAN;next-generation internet;DARPA;bandwidth-on-demand services;quality-of-service guarantee;WDM networks;fast scheduling algorithms;flexible bandwidth reservations;unreserved bandwidth;WDM broadcast network;fast-tunable transceivers;bursty traffic;allocating network resources;maximal matchings;unweighted graphs;total reserved bandwidth;constant delay bounds;network capacity;fair access algorithms;network utilization","","23","","33","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The soft thermal modulation pad (the only component that interfaces with the user) contains fluid channels, embedded temperature sensors, and a flexible protoboard, encased in graphite-based silicone.

The circuit is an interferometric delay loop and its particular configuration allows to perform a number of different functions, namely, optical buffering, differential phase-shift keying (DPSK) demodulation, intensity modulation, and differential XOR logic operation. By properly controlling the current supplied to the active elements in the circuit loop (i.e., a semiconductor optical amplifier and a variable optical attenuator), the relative phase of the propagating signals can be adjusted, changing the interference condition between the input signal and its delayed copies. In this way the four different functions are enabled. Experimental results are reported for all the different functions of the device. When the circuit is operated in buffer configuration, up to 13 circulations (corresponding to a 1.62 ns delay) of an input bit at 12.5-Gb/s data rate are shown before the output signal degrades due to excessive ring losses. Its behavior as a current-controlled DPSK demodulator is demonstrated for 8-Gb/s signals, and the resulting bit error rate measurements are compared with those of a thermally tuned commercial demodulator, showing no significant power penalty.

A novel gripper with a piezoelectric (PZT) stack and flexible mechanism is presented. A dynamic model of the PZT gripper is established, and a method of suppression control for residual vibration is proposed. The vibration characteristics of the PZT gripper are calculated using finite-element modeling (FEM) to obtain the natural frequency, vibration mode, and displacement. An input-shaping algorithm is applied to restrain the residual vibration caused by the flexible structure. The performance of the control algorithm is discussed and compared to the performance of the square, trapezoidal, and synthetic control methods. Three typical input-shaping filters-zero vibration, zero vibration differential, and extreme insensitivity-are compared, and the effects of frequency and damping on vibration suppression are discussed. In the experiment, a high-speed camera is used to track the displacement of the gripper, and the relationship between displacement and driven voltage is proven. Impedance and frequency are measured by an impedance analyzer, and the results agree with the values from the FEM. The residual vibration with the different driver control methods is recorded by a noncontact laser Doppler vibrometer. With the input-shaping control method, the residual vibration of the PZT gripper is reduced to 10%, and the settling time is reduced by 0.7 ms compared to the original vibration, demonstrating that the method improves the performance of the PZT gripper.","2156-3985","","10.1109/TCPMT.2017.2723458","Project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51475107,51605258); Basic Research Plan of Shenzhen(grant numbers:JCYJ20150403161923526,JCYJ20170413112645981); Shenzhen Technology Innovation Program(grant numbers:JCYJ20150625142543473,JSGG20150330103937411); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7993068","Dynamic model;input shaping;piezoelectric (PZT) gripper;residual vibration control;wire bond","Grippers;Vibration control;Piezoelectric devices;Bonding;Finite element analysis;Wire;Finite element analysis","finite element analysis;grippers;lead bonding;manipulator dynamics;micromanipulators;piezoelectric actuators;vibration control","suppression control;residual vibration;vibration characteristics;PZT gripper;control algorithm;synthetic control methods;vibration suppression;input-shaping control method;dynamics modeling;piezoelectric gripper;wire bonding;light-emitting diode wire bonders;flexible mechanism;dynamic model;input-shaping filters;zero vibration;driver control methods;microgripper;integrated circuit wire bonders;finite-element modeling","","13","","34","IEEE","26 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In a scenario where the wireless signals are distributed to many small remote antenna units, this will require systems which allow flexible frequency tuning of the generated THz carrier. In this paper, we demonstrate experimentally the implementation of two tuning methods using an optical frequency comb generator for coherent optical frequency tuning in THz wireless-over-fiber systems. The first method is based on using a photonic integrated circuit optical phase lock loop (OPLL) subsystem implemented as a high quality optical filter for single comb line selection and optical amplification. The OPLL generates an optical carrier, which is frequency and phase stabilized in reference to one of the optical comb lines with a frequency offset precisely selectable between 4 and 12 GHz. The second method is based on optical single sideband suppressed carrier (SSB-SC) modulation from the filtered comb line using an optical IQ modulator. With this technique, it is possible to suppress the other unwanted optical tones by more than 40 dB. This generated optical carrier is then heterodyned with another filtered optical comb line to generate a tuneable and stable THz carrier. The full system implementations for both methods are demonstrated by transmitting THz wireless signal over fiber with 20 Gb/s data in QPSK modulation. The system performance and the quality of the generated THz carrier are evaluated for both methods at different tuned THz carrier frequencies. The demonstrated methods confirm that a high quality tuneable THz carrier can easily be implemented in systems where dynamic frequency allocation is required.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2018.2846031","U.K. Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council under the Coherent TeraHertz Systems Programme(grant numbers:EP/J017671/1); Converged Optical & Wireless Access Networks(grant numbers:EP/P003990/1); European Commission through the European project iPHOS(grant numbers:257539); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8377986","Fiber wireless;high-speed wireless;microwave photonics;optical frequency comb;optical heterodyning;Photonic THz generation;radio-over-fiber","Optical mixing;Optical filters;Optical feedback;Optical modulation;Integrated optics;Optical receivers;Optical polarization","free-space optical communication;frequency allocation;integrated optics;microwave photonics;optical fibre communication;optical fibre filters;optical frequency combs;optical modulation;optical phase locked loops;optical tuning;quadrature phase shift keying;radio-over-fibre;terahertz wave generation","remote antenna units;flexible frequency tuning;tuning methods;optical frequency comb generator;coherent optical frequency tuning;photonic integrated circuit optical phase lock loop subsystem;high quality optical filter;single comb line selection;optical amplification;optical carrier;optical IQ modulator;unwanted optical tones;filtered optical comb line;THz wireless signal;dynamic frequency allocation;broadband wireless communication;optical single sideband suppressed carrier modulation;coherent THz wireless signals;THz wireless-over-fiber systems;QPSK modulation;tuned THz carrier frequencies;high quality tuneable THz carrier;frequency 4.0 GHz to 12.0 GHz","","9","","34","CCBY","11 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition to low jitter switching, optical activation provides a high degree of electrical isolation between the triggering and switching power systems simplifying pulsed power design. The disadvantages of optical triggering for large-gap gas switches are the optical energy, line-of-sight optics, and system maintenance required to obtain reliable operation. This paper describes two technologies which can reduce or eliminate these disadvantages and provide more flexible optically activated switches for pulsed power systems. One approach is to reduce the optical trigger energy requirement for gas gap switches. Shorter optical pulses require less energy to initiate a plasma discharge. An experiment is being assembled to trigger a 50-100 kV gas gap switch with 120 fs wide optical pulses. Lower trigger energy has also been demonstrated by the introduction of metallic aerosols into a gas gap W. Frey (1997). The apparatus will be added to this experiment to reproduce these results and determine the optical energy and power density requirements over a range of wavelengths and pulse widths. The status of this experiment will be discussed. A second approach uses solid state switching in two configurations: (1) as the main switch and (2) as a trigger. High-gain photoconductive semiconductor switches (PCSS) are practical for some direct pulsed power switching applications. We have demonstrated switching up to 220 kV and 8 kA. Higher power optically activated switching can be obtained by combining solid state and gas gap switching technologies. Multimegavolt (MMV) switches can be triggered with fiber-optically triggered, remotely located PCSS. By placing the compact PCSS trigger extremely close to the trigger point, reliable, low-jitter, high power switching is achieved with low energy fiber-optic trigger systems that can easily be controlled and adjusted from a remote control center. Power for the trigger system can be derived from the electrical fields near the trigger, so all electrical cables to the trigger system are eliminated and replaced with 100 micron diameter fibers that trigger and monitor the operation of the system. Results from experiments with PCSS triggered gas gap switches and the design for a PCSS triggered multimegavolt switch will be reported. PCSS switching properties including new picosecond pulse results and fabrication procedures for improved longevity will also be described. A 120 fs wide 780 nm laser pulse was used to radiate THz bandwidth pulses with a GaAs PCSS operating in the linear mode. New approaches for PCSS contact fabrication are being developed and tested to simplify the growth procedure, increase the current per filament capability, and improve device longevity.

Most of previous AI devices and systems were focused on electronic devices with pure electrical input to realize pattern recognition or language recognition. However, human can receive many other kinds of information (such as mechanical input). The research of AI with mechanical input remains elusive. Human muscle has the most important function with intelligence: dynamic training process that muscle lines can be broken first and recover to be stronger after exercise. Here, we show a graphene artificial muscle with mechanical intelligence. Multiple muscle lines can be directly printed on flexible substrate. After long run of training process, it shows three stages: decrement, enhancement and stabilized. Moreover, single artificial muscle line is built with laser-scribed graphene and shows “injured” muscle line in the first 1200 s and then start to “recover” after that. A new concept called “Force Learning” is also investigated in this work with accuracy reaching ~96%. Our work shows the great potential of building artificial muscle lines by laser-scribed graphene with the learning ability, which can offer widely applications in robot control, mechanical neuromorphic engineering.","","978-1-7281-2539-8","10.1109/EDTM47692.2020.9117928","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9117928","graphene;artificial muscle;mechanical intelligence","Training;Neuromorphic engineering;Graphene;Robot control;Learning (artificial intelligence);Muscles;Pattern recognition","biomechanics;electronic engineering computing;graphene;integrated circuits;learning (artificial intelligence);muscle;neuromorphic engineering","neuromorphic device;force learning;laser-scribed graphene;single artificial muscle line;multiple muscle lines;mechanical intelligence;graphene artificial muscle;dynamic training process;human muscle;AI;mechanical input;electrical input;electronic devices;artificial intelligence;graphene muscle","","","","3","","16 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We first identify the degree of load balancing and the number of retunings as two important, albeit conflicting, objectives in the design of reconfiguration policies. We then formulate the problem as a Markovian decision process and we develop a systematic and flexible framework in which to study reconfiguration policies.

However, the EO crosstalk due to high integration density may degrade the signal transmission performance and eventually limit the possible density of integration. In this content, the study of the EO crosstalk of a PIC and its impact is crucial. In this paper, we systematically investigate and characterize the EO crosstalk between parallel silicon Mach-Zehnder modulators (MZMs). The performance penalty due to crosstalk is measured for different integration densities and data rates. For the MZM pair with a separation of 200 μm, there is a ~-20 dB RF crosstalk in the frequency range >10 GHz, and up to 1.1 dB power penalty and 2.2 dB optical signal-to-noise ratio penalty are observed for 36-Gb/s on-off-keying signals.

Key objectives of the process design were to minimize the number of changes to sensor fabrication, insure a high level of vacuum integrity, and flexible enough to accommodate a wide range of sensor designs. Only a single change to the standard sensor fabrication is required to implement the vacuum sealing process. A seal ring of gold, 250 microns wide by 1 micron thick is applied around the perimeter of the sensor and its electrical contact pads. The key features of this vacuum sealing technology are incorporated in the silicon cap wafer. It is 200 microns thick and contains an array of cavities, 50 microns deep, which align with the MEMS devices on the glass wafer. The opposite side of the wafer is coated with 2000 angstroms of silicon dioxide and is arrayed with aluminum bond pads, which align with those on the sensor wafer. These pads are connected to the sensor by through wafer vias, which are coated with a layer of parylene, one micron thick. The parylene is applied in a vapor deposition process, and then an excimer laser is used to ablate it from the bottom of the vias to allow electrical connections to be made to the aluminum bond pads. The vias are metallized with an adhesion layer of 500 angstroms of titanium and a conduction layer of 2000 angstroms of gold. This metal is photo-patterned, to produce pads that align with those of the sensor, and then all exposed parylene is removed by reactive ion etching. This cap wafer is bonded to the sensor wafer in an ultra-high vacuum system with a base pressure of 10/sup -8/ Torr. The two wafers are held on electrostatic chucks, one of which is hinged, so that in the degas phase, both wafers can be cleaned in-situ with an ion gun. For bonding, the hinge is actuated to position the cap wafer above the sensor wafer. A pair of prisms is positioned between the wafers to allow them to be precisely aligned prior to sealing. The wafers are bonded together by heating them to 300 /spl deg/C and actuating a pair of ball screws, which clamps them together under a load of 500 Newtons. The load and temperature is maintained for one hour to allow the gold of the sensor seal ring to react with the silicon of the cap wafer. The bonded pair is slowly cooled under load to complete the sealing process. The ultimate goal of this sealing approach is to use the control ASIC chip that is paired with the sensor, as the cap structure. This would minimize the length of signal paths between the ASIC and sensor, while realizing a very compact vacuum package.","2377-5726","0-7803-8907-7","10.1109/ECTC.2005.1441406","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1441406","","Wafer scale integration;Packaging;Micromechanical devices;Wafer bonding;Silicon;Gold;Sensor arrays;Etching;Metallization;Glass","microsensors;electronics packaging;process design;seals (stoppers);wafer bonding;vacuum techniques;application specific integrated circuits","wafer level vacuum packaging;MEMS sensors;anodic bonding;metallized glass wafers;sensor fabrication;vacuum integrity;vacuum sealing process;parylene;vapor deposition;excimer laser;reactive ion etching;ASIC chip;50 micron;1 micron;250 micron;300 C","","10","2","7","","20 Jun 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Methods: A fast and simple-to-use platform that combines an integrated circuit with paper microfluidics for simultaneous detection of multiple-metabolites appropriate for diagnostics was presented. Paper based sensors are a primary candidate for widespread deployment of diagnostic or test devices. However, the majority of devices today use a simple paper strip to detect a single marker using the reflectance of light. However, for many diseases such as sepsis, one biomarker is not sufficient to make a unique diagnosis. In this work multiple measurements are made on patterned paper simultaneously. Using laser ablation to fabricate microfluidic channels on paper provides a flexible and direct approach for mass manufacture of disposable paper strips. A reusable photodiode array on a complementary metal oxide semiconductor chip is used as the transducer. Results: The system measures changes in optical absorbance in the paper to achieve a cost-effective and easily implemented system that is capable of multiple simultaneous assays. Potential sepsis metabolite biomarkers glucose and lactate have been studied and quantified with the platform, achieving sensitivity within the physiological range in human serum. Conclusion: We have detailed a disposable paper-based CMOS photodiode sensor platform for real-time simultaneous detection of metabolites for diseases such as sepsis.

A possible way to integrate more functionality into smaller volume is a system in package (SiP) approach which combines e. g. logic and power chips. Chip-embedding in laminate technology based on copper leadframes is an attractive technology for SiP. In this paper we show how to enable chip-embedding technology to integrate both logic and power functions in one package. As key enablers we identified diffusion soldering die-attach for power dies, laser direct imaging for structuring of low parasitic redistribution layers, warpage and distortion compensation, and complexity reduction in material processing. We present the results of a functional LED light engine built with our flexible 3D-SiP approach based on chip-embedding in laminate. The footprint of the light engine's power supply subsystem could be reduced by a factor of 3.8 in comparison to using standard packaged components. We verified a process chain for 3D-assembly of surface mount devices on top of the chip-embedding package, and for soldering of this 3D-SiP to the light engine board.

Recent progress in on-chip stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) using high gain has shown great potentials for RF photonic signal processing, owing to its inherent advantages of high resolution, high reconfigurability, and flexible programmability. On-chip SBS serves as a versatile and high-performance toolbox to process and manipulate the amplitude and phase of RF signals in the optical domain.

The fabricated waveguides, which embed buried 1-D (trenches) or 2-D (holes forming a photonic crystal) nanopatterns have been measured by two techniques.

Because of recent efforts to disaggregate optical transport networks, various compact disaggregate blades (e.g., wavelength selective switches and optical amplifier blades) have become commercially available. In principle, such disaggregation technology enables network operators to optimize their networks precisely at the blade level according to their distinctive needs, although the management complexity can increase with the number and diversity of the managed equipment. This paper presents transformation algorithms for mapping between a reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexer (ROADM)-based model and a disaggregate-blade-based model to realize a flexible and agile optical physical layer based on disaggregation technology without increasing control plane complexity. In this study, a disaggregate-blade-based model named functional block-based disaggregation (FBD) is used, in which the switching functionalities of individual optical components are defined by the integer linear programming (ILP) method using machine-readable GNU MathProg modeling language. By computing the ILP formula, the switching functionalities of whole nodes/networks can be analyzed; that is, the FBD model can form the ROADM-level nodal model by aggregating the individual blade models. With the developed transformation algorithms, automated network operations, including optical path establishment/removal and node structure updates, are experimentally demonstrated on a field testbed. After physically plugging in the new components, the node structure update including the logical topology information is automatically recognized within 5 min.

A master module transmits optical signals which are received by all the slave modules attached to the bus. Each slave module in turn sends data back on the bus to the master module.

Hybridization of waveguide and free-space optics, or spatial and planar optical circuits (SPOCs), may provide the solutions for such needs. An SPOC platform is attractive because it can take advantage of both waveguide technology and free-space optics. Waveguide technology provides a high degree of integration of optical functionality for devices such as splitters and non-wavelength selective switches while free-space optics supplies a high degree of parallelism with two-dimensional spatial light modulators such as a liquid crystal on silicon (LCOS) devices. In this paper, we summarize the basics of SPOC technology and review its application to reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexing (ROADM) devices. The key elements of a waveguide on an SPOC platform are an arrayed-waveguide grating and a spatial beam transformer. The latter functions as a microlens array and provides attractive features such as dense integration of switches. An LCOS device has numerous phase modulating pixels, enabling flexible manipulation of lightwaves. Using an SPOC platform, we constructed and demonstrated devices for ROADM applications including a wavelength filter, tunable optical dispersion compensators, and wavelength selective switches (WSSs).

However, their performance depends on the number of samples per data symbol needed to accurately represent the pre-equalized time domain pulse. This requirement limits the maximum data rate that can be generated by a digital-to-analog converter (DAC). Another challenge when pre-equalizing the signal applied to a transmitter is the need to restrict the maximum voltage applied to the transmitter. Given these challenges, this paper demonstrates the benefits of constructing digitally pre-equalized On-Off Keying (OOK) symbols with raised cosine pulses. In addition, results are presented which show that each symbol can be represented with as few as 5 samples per bit. The performance of the proposed equalization method is investigated using an off-the-shelf LED-based optical wireless communication (OWC) link. Using equalization, the bandwidth of the link is increased by a factor of 10 to 100 MHz.

In the processing, high speed positioning can cause strong excitation on the machine structure, which results in severe structure vibration and long settling time. Especially in multiple target positioning process, vibration exists in the whole procedure, so that the positioning means that the vibration amplitude is smaller than a given accuracy instead of completely still. According to vibration theory, new excitation will enhance or weaken the residual vibration with different phase, therefore, it is important to know what the impact of residual vibration on the continuous positioning. In this paper, the dynamic response of multiple target positioning is analyzed with flexible multibody dynamics. The optimal design of motion profile for a single positioning is performed and the positioning time is reduced by 10%. The impact of residual vibration is studied by choosing different start time, and the positioning time under corresponding residual vibration (amplitude and phase) is calculated. It is found that when the residual vibration is negative to the motion direction, the positing time is decreased, and vice versa. It is also found that the positioning time saving is much greater than the start time delay at the first few cycles. Up to 10% throughput can be improved by choosing a suitable start time for array processing. Analytic and experimental results match well. Our finding is important for improving the throughput of massive production of arrays processing in information technology.","","978-1-5090-4102-2","10.1109/ICInfA.2016.7831796","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7831796","Array processing;multiple target positioning;residual vibration;dynamic response;motion profile","Vibrations;Dynamics;Damping;Arrays;Mathematical model;Resonant frequency;Force","dynamic response;semiconductor industry;vibrations","residual vibration impact;multiple target positioning time;array operation;dynamic response;target positioning;flexible multibody dynamics;semiconductor manufacturing industry","","1","","12","","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to improve the efficiency of the whole system, a novel control strategy of an air-core pulsed alternator pair is proposed in this paper. Like a single pulsed alternator, the whole work process of the pulsed alternator pair can also be divided into three subprocesses: the self-excitation process, the discharge process, and the energy reclamation process. In the self-excitation and energy reclamation processes, the armature windings of the pulsed alternator pair are connected in series, and the filed windings are connected in parallel. In order to illustrate the advantages of this control strategy, a comprehensive discussion of different connection topologies of the alternator pair has been made in this paper. A mathematical model based on the equivalent circuit of the air-core pulsed alternator considering the harmonic components was also established in this paper, which could help calculating the system efficiency more accurately.
